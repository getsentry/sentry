# XXX: E501 is ignored, which disables line length checking.
# Currently, the black formatter doesn't wrap long strings: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/182#issuecomment-385325274
# We already have a lot of E501's - these are lines black didn't wrap.
# But rather than append # noqa: E501 to all of them, we just ignore E501 for now.
