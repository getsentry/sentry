Version 6.1.1 (Security Release)
--------------------------------

Sentry 6.1.1 is a security release which patches a remote code execution exploit.

This only affects servers hosted public clients (e.g. raven.js).

The following commit demonstrates the exploit, as well as the patch:

https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/5793c6cac19aeb7d2e19f9a09f4421b771af4306

Version 6.1.0
-------------

- Added Rate Limit controls.

Version 6.0.0
-------------

Say hello to our new logomark! Version 6 of Sentry includes many changes within
the core designed to improve future compatibility for various platforms.

It also includes quite a number of incompatible changes, so it's recommended
that plugin authors read through the notes carefully, and run some simply
sanity checks. It also introduces version 4 of the protocol.

Incompatible Changes
====================

- Django has been upgraded to 1.5.
- django.contrib.auth.models.User has been replaced with sentry.models.User.
- sentry_servers no longer exists, and the behavior is now always present. If
  you had it manually listed in INSTALLED_APPS, simply remove it.
- Filters have been deprecated, and most functionality removed. See notes below.
- TrackedUser, AffectedByUser, and Group.users_seen have been removed in favor
  of reusing the tagging architecture for user tracking.
- Suspension of team members is no longer available. The feature was rarely
  used, and removing it greatly simplifies the auth logic in the API.
- **The mail plugin can no longer be disabled, and all mail-specific options
  have been removed.**
- Nearly all data within an event now has a fixed max size. See client
  developer documentation for details.
- Project keys are no longer created for individuals by default
- sentry.conf.settings has been removed
- LOG_LEVELS, DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL, and DEFAULT_LOGGER_NAME are no longer configurable.
- DEFAULT_ALERT_PROJECT_THRESHOLD and DEFAULT_ALERT_GROUP_THRESHOLD are no longer
  configurable.
- SENTRY_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX and SENTRY_SERVER_EMAIL are no longer used, and default to
  the appropriate Django options.
- SENTRY_CACHE_BACKEND is no longer configurable.
- SENTRY_AUTH_PROVIDERS is now AUTH_PROVIDERS.
- Existing account recovery tokens are no longer valid.
- sentry.utils.router has been removed.

Protocol Version 4
==================

- sentry_version should be sent as '4'.
- Aliases are now recommended instead of full interface names.
- The exception interface now supports a bound stacktrace, and all events
  (in all protocols) which contain both an exception and a stacktrace will
  be rolled up. This should be sent as the ``stacktrace`` attribute.
- The exception interface now supports chained exceptions, and should
  be sent as a list of exception values. Check the updated documentation for
  ordering details.

Alerts
======

A basic alert system has been added.

- Configured at the project level.
- Signaled via Plugin.on_alert.

Filters
=======

The outdated filter system has been mostly removed. You should rely on
tagged data for filter generation.

If you were previously defining ``SENTRY_FILTERS`` you should remove it
from your settings as it will be entirely obsolete in a future version.

Other Changes
=============

- Activity feeds will now attempt to filter out some duplicates.
- Tags now show on the event details page.
- Corrected some invalid behavior when storing tags with an individual event.
- Plugin.get_tag_values was added.
- A new team select dashboard exists if you are a member of multiple teams.
- A new Sentry logo mark has replaced the simple text header.
- C# has been added to experimental clients.

Version 5.4.0
-------------

SENTRY_PUBLIC now dictates whether or not a Sentry install should be considered
accessible by all users or not. This should better solve the use-case of companies
hosting a Sentry instance internally and not necessarily needing the permissions
that teams give you.

If enabled, all teams and all projects will be accessible all members (for any endpoint
which does not require a certain level of access). Project.is_public now dictates the
implied state of all events, but will not allow a non-member to browse events.

Additionally, this includes the following other items:

- [Important!] The URLS for social authentication have been moved.
- Improved rendering of data values in all interfaces.
- django-compressor was replaced with django-static-compiler.
- A better defined public view of events (which removes several items from being visible).
- Improved SourceMap discovery.
- Most events will no longer cause a hard error when validation fails. Instead we attempt
  to drop any non-required data so that at least a partial event is stored.
- MessageCountByMinute was renamed to GroupCountByMinute.
- MessageFilterValue was renamed to GroupTag.
- Syntax highlighting was disabled (pending performance solutions).
- Added Team.date_added column.
- Lots of various design changes.
- Trending SQL queries can now be disabled by setting
  ``SENTRY_USE_TRENDING = False``


Version 5.3.0
-------------

A brand new Sentry design has landed.

Some things of note:

- An improved dashboard.
- Improved activity feeds on aggregate details.
- Similar event navigation links on aggregate details.
- Redesigned team management flow.

Additionally:

- Aggregates now happen on (project, checksum), which means events that have different
  levels or culprits can now be grouped together.
- Sentry now requires authentication for all pages.
- SENTRY_PUBLIC behavior has changed to signify the default state of projects.
- Project slug's are now only unique within a team.

Version 5.2.2

Additional, the following client protocol changes are part of this release:

- Cookies should be not be sent by default.
- POST data should not be sent by default.
- Recommended values regexp for sanitizing credit cards was updated.
- ``colno`` was added to the Stacktrace spec.
- Timestamps that are more than one minute in the future are now discarded.
- (Undocumented) Client-side support now exists for GET + Referrer store requests.

We've also reduced the test suite time down to 25% of what it originally was (thanks, Alex!)

Version 5.1.3
-------------

A new user's affected-tracking mechanism is present (storage only). This will
become available in the UX in a future version, and relies on the existing HTTP
and User interface datas.

- [Fix] Correct a bug with search queries.
- [New] Group.users_seen will now track unique users when possible.
- [New] Team and project owners can now change ownership (non-superuser).
- [Fix] Counts are now formatted correctly when number of visible digits > 3.

- [Fix] The time since value now updates correctly when events change.
- Various changes to how event details components render.
- Various fixes for breadcrumbs and header styles.
- Most plugins will no longer default to enabled on new projects.

Version 5.1.0
-------------

Minor point releases now signify major changes (5.1.0 is a major release). Bugfix and smaller
releases will continue as normal.

This release includes a very large set of changes from 5.0.0, including a new client protocol
and an overhaul to the frontend code (specifically the JavaScript).

If you're a contributor, take note that there is now a JavaScript test suite. You can run all
test suites with the ``make test`` command.

Protocol Version 3
==================

Sentry 5.1 removes support for version 1.0 of the protocol, and maintains a compatibility layer
for version 2.0.

Additionally, the following changes apply to the new protocol:

- sentry_version should be sent as '3' (not 3.0).
- Signed messages are no longer supported (signatures are not calculated).
  - sentry_signature is no longer used.
  - sentry_timestamp is no longer used.
- Clients must pass sentry_secret for server-side requests as part of the auth
  header. This check runs in the event that there is no Origin header sent.
  - version 2.0 supports validation of this, version 3 requires it.
- The ``project`` attribute in the JSON packet is no longer required.
- The ``platform`` attribute is now recommended.
- The ``tags`` attribute is now recommended.

Other Changes
=============

- Aggregation 'Views' have been removed.
- All streaming components are now powered by Backbone.js.
- Frontend has been updated to Bootstrap 2.1.
- The event stream now includes sparklines representing the last 24 hours of data for each event.
- Trends have greatly improved.
- Grouping events that have identical stacktraces other than the function name (e.g. dynamically generated
  functions) is not possible.
- SiteFilter has been removed, as has the sites plugin.
- If frames are included in a stacktrace that have the attribute ``in_app: false``, they will be hidden by default in
  the details view.
- crossdomain.xml support is now available (see documentation).
- The search feature now uses buffers to better handle write concurrency.
- Early support for WSGI (should be functional) exists as ``sentry.wsgi``.
- Many fixes around cache usage.

Version 5.0.0
-------------

- Variable versions of Django are no longer supported. Django 1.4.x must now be used.
- Public projects are restricted to viewing without being authenticated.
- The default behavior of Sentry is to now use timezone-aware datetimes everywhere.
- Permissions have been refactored to be more precise.


Version 4.10.0
--------------

- A new IssuePlugin base is available.
- Charts have been refactored to show 7 days worth of data.
- django.contrib.staticfiles is now supported.
- django.contrib.messages is now supported.

Version 4.9.0
-------------

Social authentication is now supported!

By configuring several options (documented on the quickstart guide), you can allow users to signup and login
with accounts from several social services. Additionally users can associate their existing accounts (via a
new identities panel in their account settings) with any number of these services.

Currently, the following services are supported:

* GitHub
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Google

Version 4.8.0
-------------

Tags are now able to be created dynamically! See the documentation for more details on implementing it inside
of your client.

You can also configure which tags will show up as filters in the sidebar via your project's settings page. By
default all tags will show up.

Version 4.7.0
-------------

User options are now available to plugins. The builtin mail plugin also now takes advantage of them.

- sentry_mail will now use the alert_email option over your account email if specified.
- sentry_mail now allows you to choose which projects to receive alerts for.
- Numeric slugs will no longer return 404s.
- Corrected the repair command with the --owner argument.

Version 4.6.0
-------------

Improvements to the dashboard are trickling in, with this update including:

- Changing "Top Events" to "Trends" (if supported by your RDBMS)
- Time interval selections for both widgets

Plugins now have a new interface for registering themselves. Please see the developer documentation
for notes on how to use ``entry_points``.

Additionally:

- Signed messages are now deprecated. Save yourself some CPU cycles, and rely on SSL.
- A new plugin which tags user's email addresses.
- Several UI cleanups in various areas, such as improvements to the account dropdown and lists of projects/teams.
- Long awaited cleanup/fixes for applying the initial database migrations (sorry MySQL users).
- Initial support for arbitrary event tagging (coming soon to a client near you).

Version 4.5.0
-------------

Builtin plugins have been refactored to be more concise. This includes changes to the
servers, urls, and sites plugins. There is also a new builtin plugin::

  sentry.plugins.sentry_useragents

With these changes, it now makes it even easier to create a basic plugin that just handles extra
"tag"-like data. Take a look at one of the aforementioned plugins for an example.

Additionally:

- The mail plugin now sends additional Sentry-specific headers.
- Signatures are deprecated, and no longer required.
- Several fixes regarding CORS support.

Version 4.4.0
-------------

Two new columns were added to the ``Group`` model:

- ``resolved_at``: The datetime at which this event was marked as resolved.
- ``active_at``:  The datetime at which this event was marked as open.

The dashboard's "New Events" will now use the active_at date rather than the original
first seen date on an event.

Version 4.3.0
-------------

A new global dashboard now exists. The dashboard contains an event graph for all projects which
you have access to, as well as a list of the top events, and new events.

Additionally:

- API endpoints now properly send no-cache headers.
- Added a countdown to update buffers.

Version 4.2.0
-------------

Sentry now has support for buffering a majority of its counters via Redis. For more information, check
the buffer section of the configuration documentation.

- Nearly all race conditions are now handled correctly using distributed cache locks.

Version 4.1.0
-------------

Sentry now maintains full support for CORS requests from external hosts. This means that clients like
raven-js will now able to securely send messages to Sentry, without compromising their secret key.

In addition:

- Trusted domains were removed. These were not fully implemented.
- A new datepicker for selecting ranges of events.
- raven-javascript and raven-ruby are now officially supported clients.
- Added ``sentry repair``.

Version 4.0.0
-------------

Introducing Teams!

Projects are now assigned to a single team, and that team may consist of many members. Additionally
each team may own multiple projects. This makes it much easier to handle permissions across a single
organization that has many projects.

This update also includes initial changes to how filters work. ServerName Filter and SiteFilter are
no longer specified in the ``FILTERS`` setting, but instead are included automatically if you
load the respective ``sentry_servers`` and ``sentry_sites`` plugins.

Additional changes:

- Legacy data format is no longer supported (pre-Raven 1.x)
- API will now validate data before sending it into the queue, enabling better debugging for clients.

Version 3.8.0
-------------

Plugins are now configurable per-project. This makes it easy to install a plugin globally
and allow it to run only on selective projects.

Version 3.7.0
-------------

Several minor fixes, as well as a backwards incompatible change with filters.

All filters must now accept the project argument in the initializer. The signature is
now __init__(request, project).

Version 3.6.0
-------------

This version focuses on improving membership control. It includes the ability to revoke
project members access temporarily (by suspending them), as well as revoking users
(outside of Sentry) via the user.is_active flag.

Additionally, it brings the beginnings of an "invite user" flow, allowing you to
invite users who may or may not already have accounts in the system. We plan to improve
this flow in an upcoming release to allow invitees easy registration within the system
if they don't already have an account.

Version 3.5.0
-------------

Several improvements and additions have been made around the administration, including
performance improvements.

If you're utilizing the queue, the installation guide now recommends you switch off the
database backend, and move to something more efficient (such as Redis).

Version 3.4.0
-------------

Eventlet is no longer used as the default worker for gunicorn, and thus is no longer
installed by default. If you're using the udp worker, or ``send_fake_data`` you MUST
install eventlet yourself. The recommended worker class for gunicorn is now ``gevent``
as it corrects some issues with async queries in psycopg2.

Version 3.3.0
-------------

The queue has been changed from direct Kombu, to utilizing Celery entirely. If you were
already using the queue, the upgrade simply requires you to change "sentry start worker"
to "sentry celeryd".

Version 3.0.0
-------------

Version 3 of Sentry is centered around a restructure of the internal services and
the architecture for running those. It also includes improvements to the plugin architecture.

The upgrade process should be trivial, just be aware that if you were using --config before
you must change the way you pass it so that it's before the subcommand. For example
if you were doing ``sentry start --config...`` the command would now be changed to
``sentry --config... start``.

* Sentry no longer provides the ability to daemonize processes. This should now be
  done at the system level.
* All of Sentry's CLI is now handled through Logan (https://github.com/dcramer/logan),
  which simply pipes commands to Django's internal system utilizing custom configuration.

  This API is available for most sort options, excluding trends.
* The builtin plugin's widgets have been fixed.
* Sampling rates are now configurable.
* Some minor design tweaks.
