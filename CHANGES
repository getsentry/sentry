v9.1.1
------

- Bug fixes from 9.1.0 release.

v9.1
----

The changelog for Sentry 9.1 is summarized. For full details, we recommend reviewing the
full set of SCM changes on GitHub.

First, an important preface:

FUTURE VERSIONS OF SENTRY WILL INTRODUCE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE

This is the last version in the 9.x series, and our next release will migrate many legacy technologies onto standardized versions our SaaS service uses. The most notable, known concerns are:

- Postgres will be the only supported SQL database
- Our new search infrastructure (codenamed Snuba) will become required (we'll provide a migration path)
- Various new infrastructure services will be required (such as Kafka)

This is required for Sentry to continue to support open source releases in a meaningful way, and ensures we have only a single, standard way of running the services.

Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've added a new global integration concept to Sentry, which raises plugins to the organization level. Access to these integrations are controlled with the `org:integrations` scope, and are granted to any user with an Admin or higher role.

This release includes integrations for:

- Azure DevOps
- BitBucket
- GitHub
- GitHub Enterprise
- GitLab
- Jira
- Jira Server

There is additionally a Slack integration, though it requires a now-deprecated workspace token in order to use.

Note: a known issue exists where integrations are always shown as enabled, even when you haven't configured the appropriate server settings (such as OAuth keys).

Native Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various improvements for native (compiled) runtimes is included in this release.

- Improved rendering for native stacktraces.
- Improved support for Apple crash reports.
- Added unreal engine 4 crash dump support.
- Added code identifier support for debug files.

Security
~~~~~~~~

- Added SAML2 SSO support.
- Member invitations will now automatically expire after 30 days.
- Fixed potential settings exposure if sentry was deployed in DEBUG mode.

Misc
~~~~

- Settings have been greatly improved and updated to allow non-admins read-only access in many areas.
- Added additional localization configuration for User Feedback dialogs.
- Added account session history under Account Settings -> Security -> Session History.
- Event data stored in Redis & RabbitMQ no longer uses pickle to encode data. All data is now encoded in JSON.
- Various improvements to CSP and other browser Reporting API support.
- Many features disabled via feature flags now indicate how to enable them in the UI.
- Improved suspect commit generation for Java projects.
- Repository access is now coupled to integrations access (`org:integrations`)
- Various improvements to exception fingerprinting.

v9.0
----

The changelog for Sentry 9 is summarized. For full details, we recommend reviewing the
full set of SCM changes on GitHub. There are far too many changes to list in Sentry 9,
but the major highlights are documented below.

There are also significant schema and data changes in this release, so plan for a huge amount
of updates and a measurable increase in utilization of your data stores.

Note: Major features which are undocumented here should be considered unstable, and are almost
certainly behind a feature switch which is intended to be disabled.

Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

We've removed the project-manager-esque dashboard and brought back a team/card based selection as
as a new sidebar for quick access. We will continue to iterate on what projects mean in Sentry
going forward and this is simply a first step towards future changes.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

A new global settings UI has been introduced. This is an attempt to unify all settings and make
it easier to find the numerous configuration options throughout Sentry.

Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Environments have been moved up in the hierarchy and are now a first class citizen. While
still early, this is intended to replace the need for having separate projects per environment.

To use environments you simply need to ensure you're configuring the ``environment`` parameter
in the Sentry SDK, and it should automatically propagate into Sentry proper.

Owners
~~~~~~

A new owners feature allows you to define per-project rules for declaring explicit ownership.
Much like GitHub's .gitowners, this helps Sentry understand who is responsible for a specific
issue, and more importantly lets you limit email alerts to only the relevant parties.

In addition to explicit owners, the release framework has expanded to support implicit owners
and suspect commits. This currently only works with GitHub.com hosted repositories, but will be
expanded to support other providers in future versions of Sentry.

Teams & Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects can now be associated with many teams, and teams can be referenced in comments and
assignment as well as the new ownership features.

Both Team and Project names have been deprecated, and the short name as been promoted as the
canonical reference. Teams can be mentioned using #team-name.

Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The beginnings of the new integration framework (plugin v3) have landed, along with an initial
version of a new Slack integration.

The new integrations framework will likely change in upcoming versions of Sentry, and we dont
suggest building against it yet.

Some caveats:

- The Slack integration requires Slack workspace tokens.
- While there is some early work of other integrations in this release, they are not yet GA nor
  are they exposed.

API
~~~

Various portions of processing for the API will require additional dependencies and configuration
(such as symbolic).

- The 'secret key' for a DSN is no longer required and has been deprecated in SDKs.
- Added support for Minidumps generated by Breakpad and Crashpad.
- Added support for Cordova and Electron.
- A new standard 'security report' endpoint has been exposed, which supports HKPK, CSP,
  Expect-CT, and Expect-Staple reports.
- Improved reprocessing feature.
- Improved support for native Debug Symbols (Apple, Linux).
- The ingestion API is now JSON-schema based (though still fairly flexible).
- Added setup wizard for various SDKs (e.g. react-native).

Privacy Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of GDPR, the open source version of Sentry now changes the default policy for its beacon
(the service which tells sentry.io statistics about open source usage) to **not** send the system's
contact email address by default. You can still opt-in to this, which will allow us to contact you
in the event of a major security issue.

Misc
~~~~

- User Feedback will now send an email notification.
- Almost all major UI components are now driven by the client-side application.
- Avatars have been added for organizations.
- Various improvements to issue hashing, specifically for native (iOS) and javascript
  applications.

  you're using as part of this (sentry-auth-github, sentry-auth-google).

- Added basic organization on-boarding.
- Project keys are no longer usable within the web API.
- Allow requiring data scrubbing security options as an organization wide setting.

v8.0.0
------

Version 8 of Sentry introduces a brand new frontend. Most of the application has been overhauled
and rewritten on top of React and our web API. Additionally many new features have been exposed
related to workflows (user assignment, snooze, resolution) and release tracking. This changelog
does not attempt to capture the six+ months of incremental features and improvements in this
release of Sentry.

A Note on MySQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to numerous issues over the years and recent discoveries that nearly all schema migration was
broken in MySQL (due to some behavior in our migration tool), we've made the decision to no longer
support MySQL. It is possible to bring the schema up to date on a MySQL machine, but Sentry's
automated migrations will likely not work and require DBA assistance.

Postgres is now the only supported production database.

A Note on Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the past it was supported to run Sentry's queue workers with the `-B` option to also spawn
a celery beat process within the worker.  This is no longer supported as it causes problems in
some queue setups (in particular if redis is being used).  Instead you should now spawn two
independent processes.  This is outlined in the installation documentation.

Changes to Quotas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Team and System based quotas are now longer available. A new organization-relative project quota replaces them
and can be configured via Rate Limits on the organization dashboard.

Notification Digests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email notifications will now automatically rollup if the rate of notifications exceeds a threshold. These can be
configured on a per project basis in Project Settings.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Install Wizard has been added to aid in configuring necessary first-run options. Notably your Admin Email,
and URL Prefix. The Installation Wizard will also help any future updates and aid when new options are introduced.

A new configuration backend is now utilized for several options. These options can now be
configured via the web UI.

- A new configuration file, `config.yml` has been introduced. This new file is generated during `sentry init`
  the first time, and expected to be pointed at a directory. `config.yml` is the home for new configuration options that will be moved from the existing python config file.

- ``SENTRY_URL_PREFIX`` has been deprecated, and moved to `system.url-prefix` inside of `config.yml` or it
  can be configured at runtime.

- ``INTERNAL_IPS``, if configured, will now restrict superuser access to only users with both ``is_superuser``
  and a matching IP.

CLI
~~~

The `sentry` CLI tooling has been rewritten to be faster and less confusing.

Static files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Static files are now served with a far-futures Cache-Control header, and are versioned by default. If you were serving `/_static/` explicitly from your server config, you may need to update your rules or adjust the `STATIC_URL` setting accordingly.

General
~~~~~~~

- Source builds now require Node 0.12.x or newer.
- The ``public`` setting on projects has been removed
  - This also removes ``SENTRY_ALLOW_PUBLIC_PROJECTS``

  is now stored as a string.
- The internal metrics backend now supports both Datadog and a simple logging implementation (useful in DEBUG).
- Member roles can now view client keys (DSNs).
- Documentation for configuration wizards is now pulled from docs.getsentry.com as part
  of the ``upgrade`` and ``repair`` processes.
- The SSO flow for existing users has been greatly improved to avoid duplicate accounts.
- Deletions are delayed for one hour and can be cancelled by changing the status
  back to ``VISIBLE``.
- Membership permissions have been overhauled and have been flattened into a single tiered
  role. Additionally owners will no longer be automatically added to new teams.
- ``NotificationPlugin`` now requires ``is_configured`` to be declared.
- ``sentry.search`` should no longer be extended (``index`` and ``upgrade`` have been removed)

Client API
~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``culprit`` attribute will now automatically be filled when not present.
- The ``in_app`` attribute on frames will now be computed on event submission when not present.
- The ``ip_address`` value will always be stored on the user interface when possible.

v7.0.0
------

Between version 6.4.x and 7.0 a significant number of changes have landed (approximately a years worth of commits). There are a large number of overall architecture changes, as well as various API compatibility changes. This document does not attempt to cover them all.

As many things have changed, it's strongly recommended that you regenerate your ``sentry.conf.py`` (using ``sentry init``) and merge in your custom settings.

Backwards Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Django has been upgraded to 1.6
- The buffer API has been rewritten and the Redis buffer has had its performance greatly improved.
- The UDP server has been removed. Threaded/async models or a buffer proxy are the preferred replacement.
- The ``is_rate_limited`` plugin hook has been removed in favor of singular quota managers.
- The trends feature has been removed until it can be reimplemented in a more scalable way.
- Filters have been removed. Integrations should use the tagging infrastructure instead.
- ``NodeStore.generate_id()`` now returns a base64-encoded UUID.
- The API for interfaces has been rewritten.
- ``GroupMeta.objects.get_value`` no longer errors when a value is missing.
- ``sentry.plugins.sentry_sites`` has been removed.
- The Search API has been rewritten and now powers the entire stream.
- Removed Event.{logger,site,logger,level,culprit} references/columns. Legacy attributes for transitional behavior are available.
- Removed Project.owner.
- Removed Team.owner.
- ``is_new`` in ``Plugin.post_process`` will **only** be set if the event is brand new.
- Project-based URLs are changed to be organization scoped instead of team scoped.
- Static assets are no longer bundled as part of the repository and are instead compiled during the sdist/installation phases (as needed). See installation notes for further information.
- Graphs have been transitiong to ``sentry.tsdb`` (historical data is not preserved)
- Workers must now also run ``celerybeat``. This can be done either via passing -B to worker, or by running another process: ``sentry celerybeat``.
- Access Groups are now deprecated and will be removed in a version version.

Organizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Organizations are the new top-level item of your Sentry install. All membership and team management has been moved into the new organization hub.

Generally for self-hosted installations you'll only have a single organization.

Migrations will happen automatically for this, and while these were able to applied cleanly and automatically on getsentry.com, we suggest considering snapshotting your database before running them. Additionally consider doing this at a period of the day where users generally wont be tweaking options to team membership.

TSDB
~~~~

A new time-series backend is now used (removing the legacy SQL-based graphing solutions). The only currently supported/bundled backend requires Redis. More information can be found in ``sentry.tsdb``.

Rules
~~~~~

A new system for basic controls around notifications (called Rules) has been added. These are per-project hooks for doing dynamic customization of "what happens when a new event is seen?".

Web API
~~~~~~~

The first offering a public API has landed. You'll find it with the new embedded docs (at /docs/).

Protocol Version 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 6 of the protocol has been introduced. The only change is the addition of the `release` attribute.

BIGINT
~~~~~~

All integer fields have been replaced with bigint's. This migration is *not* automated (due to it causing locking) and if you need it locally you will need to sort out the migration on your own, as well as set `SENTRY_USE_BIG_INTS = True` in your configuration.

Help Pages
~~~~~~~~~~

The beginnings of bundled documentation now exists. The defaults are generated from disk (see sentry/data/help_pages/).


v6.4.0
------

Some major backend changes are introduced in Sentry 6.4.0.

django.contrib.auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The builtin Django authentication module is no more. The Group and Permission models are no
longer used, and the User model has been replaced with sentry.User.

Search
~~~~~~

Search has been abstracted from the simple search manager, and now lives within
``sentry.search``. Currently only the Django backend is supported, but some sample
code for Solr Cloud integration is also available.

Event Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new application called ``nodestore`` now manages the event blob data. By default it
uses a Django-based backend (storing each node as a row in a table), however a Riak
backend is included and fully supported.

Additional Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Some initial support for time zones (user setting).
- You can now choose which tag annotations are applied to the event stream via Project Settings -> Tags.
- A new subsystem for handling email is available in ``sentry.utils.email``.
- You can now receive email notifications for notes.
- Charts now show tooltips describing the datapoint.
- JavaScript sourcemaps now support embedded sources.
- Stream annotations can now be customized to show any tags (not just number of users).
- Stacktrace frames now get truncated down to a maximum length of 50.

Protocol Version 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- sentry_version should be sent as '5'.
- The stacktrace interface now accepts a 'frames_omitted' tuple.

v6.3.0
------

- Most of the db utilities were refactored into ``sentry.db``.
- The user interface now accepts an ``ip_address`` attribute.
- User tracking will now use the ip_address attribute if available.
- ``time_spent`` is now expected to be sent as an integer in milliseconds.
- A new Notes feature is available for leaving comments on an event.

v6.2.0
------

- Added tracking to which users have seen which groups
- The stream now reflects if you've viewed an event since it was created or regressed.
- The group details page shows other users who have glanced at an event.
- Streams which have recorded user data will now show the number of unique users
  an event has happened to.
- Various stream polling fixes and improvements.

v6.1.1 (Security Release)
-------------------------

Sentry 6.1.1 is a security release which patches a remote code execution exploit.

This only affects servers hosted public clients (e.g. raven.js).

The following commit demonstrates the exploit, as well as the patch:

https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/5793c6cac19aeb7d2e19f9a09f4421b771af4306

v6.1.0
------

- Added Rate Limit controls.

v6.0.0
------

Say hello to our new logomark! Version 6 of Sentry includes many changes within
the core designed to improve future compatibility for various platforms.

It also includes quite a number of incompatible changes, so it's recommended
that plugin authors read through the notes carefully, and run some simply
sanity checks. It also introduces version 4 of the protocol.

Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Django has been upgraded to 1.5.
- django.contrib.auth.models.User has been replaced with sentry.models.User.
- sentry_servers no longer exists, and the behavior is now always present. If
  you had it manually listed in INSTALLED_APPS, simply remove it.
- Filters have been deprecated, and most functionality removed. See notes below.
- TrackedUser, AffectedByUser, and Group.users_seen have been removed in favor
  of reusing the tagging architecture for user tracking.
- Suspension of team members is no longer available. The feature was rarely
  used, and removing it greatly simplifies the auth logic in the API.
- **The mail plugin can no longer be disabled, and all mail-specific options
  have been removed.**
- Nearly all data within an event now has a fixed max size. See client
  developer documentation for details.
- Project keys are no longer created for individuals by default
- sentry.conf.settings has been removed
- LOG_LEVELS, DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL, and DEFAULT_LOGGER_NAME are no longer configurable.
- DEFAULT_ALERT_PROJECT_THRESHOLD and DEFAULT_ALERT_GROUP_THRESHOLD are no longer
  configurable.
- SENTRY_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX and SENTRY_SERVER_EMAIL are no longer used, and default to
  the appropriate Django options.
- SENTRY_CACHE_BACKEND is no longer configurable.
- SENTRY_AUTH_PROVIDERS is now AUTH_PROVIDERS.
- Existing account recovery tokens are no longer valid.
- sentry.utils.router has been removed.

Protocol Version 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- sentry_version should be sent as '4'.
- Aliases are now recommended instead of full interface names.
- The exception interface now supports a bound stacktrace, and all events
  (in all protocols) which contain both an exception and a stacktrace will
  be rolled up. This should be sent as the ``stacktrace`` attribute.
- The exception interface now supports chained exceptions, and should
  be sent as a list of exception values. Check the updated documentation for
  ordering details.

Alerts
~~~~~~

A basic alert system has been added.

- Configured at the project level.
- Signaled via Plugin.on_alert.

Filters
~~~~~~~

The outdated filter system has been mostly removed. You should rely on
tagged data for filter generation.

If you were previously defining ``SENTRY_FILTERS`` you should remove it
from your settings as it will be entirely obsolete in a future version.

Other Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Activity feeds will now attempt to filter out some duplicates.
- Tags now show on the event details page.
- Corrected some invalid behavior when storing tags with an individual event.
- Plugin.get_tag_values was added.
- A new team select dashboard exists if you are a member of multiple teams.
- A new Sentry logo mark has replaced the simple text header.
- C# has been added to experimental clients.

v5.4.0
------

SENTRY_PUBLIC now dictates whether or not a Sentry install should be considered
accessible by all users or not. This should better solve the use-case of companies
hosting a Sentry instance internally and not necessarily needing the permissions
that teams give you.

If enabled, all teams and all projects will be accessible all members (for any endpoint
which does not require a certain level of access). Project.is_public now dictates the
implied state of all events, but will not allow a non-member to browse events.

Additionally, this includes the following other items:

- [Important!] The URLS for social authentication have been moved.
- Improved rendering of data values in all interfaces.
- django-compressor was replaced with django-static-compiler.
- A better defined public view of events (which removes several items from being visible).
- Improved SourceMap discovery.
- Most events will no longer cause a hard error when validation fails. Instead we attempt
  to drop any non-required data so that at least a partial event is stored.
- MessageCountByMinute was renamed to GroupCountByMinute.
- MessageFilterValue was renamed to GroupTag.
- Syntax highlighting was disabled (pending performance solutions).
- Added Team.date_added column.
- Lots of various design changes.
- Trending SQL queries can now be disabled by setting
  ``SENTRY_USE_TRENDING = False``


v5.3.0
------

A brand new Sentry design has landed.

Some things of note:

- An improved dashboard.
- Improved activity feeds on aggregate details.
- Similar event navigation links on aggregate details.
- Redesigned team management flow.

Additionally:

- Aggregates now happen on (project, checksum), which means events that have different
  levels or culprits can now be grouped together.
- Sentry now requires authentication for all pages.
- SENTRY_PUBLIC behavior has changed to signify the default state of projects.
- Project slug's are now only unique within a team.

v5.2.2
------

- [New] The dashboard will now stream updates to the new and trending event components.

v5.2.1
------

- [Fix] Trends sorting options on the Stream page work correctly again.

v5.2.0
------

- [New] A new activity stream exists on event pages.
- [New] Syntax highlighting now exists on all context frames.
- [New] Support for JavaScript Sourcemaps now exists.
- [New] The server will now fetch remote source files for JavaScript events.
- [New] Sentry will now ask for your project's platform.
- [Fix] Resolved -> Regressed state change is now atomic.
- [Fix] ``cleanup`` now runs with lower resource overhead.
- [Fix] Cookies will now be coerced to dicts if possible.
- More (storage only still) work on user tracking.
- Several indexes were added to speed up various queries.

releases will continue as normal.

This release includes a very large set of changes from 5.0.0, including a new client protocol
and an overhaul to the frontend code (specifically the JavaScript).

If you're a contributor, take note that there is now a JavaScript test suite. You can run all
test suites with the ``make test`` command.

Protocol Version 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sentry 5.1 removes support for version 1.0 of the protocol, and maintains a compatibility layer
for version 2.0.

Additionally, the following changes apply to the new protocol:

- sentry_version should be sent as '3' (not 3.0).
- Signed messages are no longer supported (signatures are not calculated).
  - sentry_signature is no longer used.
  - sentry_timestamp is no longer used.
- Clients must pass sentry_secret for server-side requests as part of the auth
  header. This check runs in the event that there is no Origin header sent.
  - version 2.0 supports validation of this, version 3 requires it.
- The ``project`` attribute in the JSON packet is no longer required.
- The ``platform`` attribute is now recommended.
- The ``tags`` attribute is now recommended.

Other Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Aggregation 'Views' have been removed.
- All streaming components are now powered by Backbone.js.
- Frontend has been updated to Bootstrap 2.1.
- The event stream now includes sparklines representing the last 24 hours of data for each event.
- Trends have greatly improved.
- Grouping events that have identical stacktraces other than the function name (e.g. dynamically generated
  functions) is not possible.
- SiteFilter has been removed, as has the sites plugin.

- Early support for WSGI (should be functional) exists as ``sentry.wsgi``.
- Many fixes around cache usage.

v5.0.0

- django.contrib.staticfiles is now supported.
- django.contrib.messages is now supported.

v4.9.0
------

Social authentication is now supported!

By configuring several options (documented in the getting started guide), you can allow users to signup and login
with accounts from several social services. Additionally users can associate their existing accounts (via a
new identities panel in their account settings) with any number of these services.

Currently, the following services are supported:

* GitHub
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Google

v4.8.0
------

Tags are now able to be created dynamically! See the documentation for more details on implementing it inside
of your client.

You can also configure which tags will show up as filters in the sidebar via your project's settings page. By
default all tags will show up.

v4.7.0
------

User options are now available to plugins. The builtin mail plugin also now takes advantage of them.

- sentry_mail will now use the alert_email option over your account email if specified.
- sentry_mail now allows you to choose which projects to receive alerts for.
- Numeric slugs will no longer return 404s.

v4.6.0
------

Improvements to the dashboard are trickling in, with this update including:

- Changing "Top Events" to "Trends" (if supported by your RDBMS)
- Time interval selections for both widgets

Plugins now have a new interface for registering themselves. Please see the developer documentation
for notes on how to use ``entry_points``.

Additionally:

- Signed messages are now deprecated. Save yourself some CPU cycles, and rely on SSL.
- A new plugin which tags user's email addresses.
- Several UI cleanups in various areas, such as improvements to the account dropdown and lists of projects/teams.
- Long awaited cleanup/fixes for applying the initial database migrations (sorry MySQL users).
- Initial support for arbitrary event tagging (coming soon to a client near you).

v4.5.0
------

Builtin plugins have been refactored to be more concise. This includes changes to the
servers, urls, and sites plugins. There is also a new builtin plugin::

  sentry.plugins.sentry_useragents

With these changes, it now makes it even easier to create a basic plugin that just handles extra
"tag"-like data. Take a look at one of the aforementioned plugins for an example.

Additionally:

- The mail plugin now sends additional Sentry-specific headers.
- Signatures are deprecated, and no longer required.
- Several fixes regarding CORS support.

v4.4.0
------

Two new columns were added to the ``Group`` model:

- ``resolved_at``: The datetime at which this event was marked as resolved.
- ``active_at``:  The datetime at which this event was marked as open.

The dashboard's "New Events" will now use the active_at date rather than the original
first seen date on an event.

v4.3.0
------

A new global dashboard now exists. The dashboard contains an event graph for all projects which
you have access to, as well as a list of the top events, and new events.

Additionally:

- API endpoints now properly send no-cache headers.
- Added a countdown to update buffers.

v4.2.0
------

Sentry now has support for buffering a majority of its counters via Redis. For more information, check
the buffer section of the configuration documentation.

- Nearly all race conditions are now handled correctly using distributed cache locks.

v4.1.0
------

Sentry now maintains full support for CORS requests from external hosts. This means that clients like
raven-js will now able to securely send messages to Sentry, without compromising their secret key.

In addition:

- Trusted domains were removed. These were not fully implemented.
- A new datepicker for selecting ranges of events.
- raven-javascript and raven-ruby are now officially supported clients.
- Added ``sentry repair``.

v4.0.0
------

Introducing Teams!

Projects are now assigned to a single team, and that team may consist of many members. Additionally
each team may own multiple projects. This makes it much easier to handle permissions across a single
organization that has many projects.

This update also includes initial changes to how filters work. ServerName Filter and SiteFilter are
no longer specified in the ``FILTERS`` setting, but instead are included automatically if you
load the respective ``sentry_servers`` and ``sentry_sites`` plugins.

Additional changes:

- Legacy data format is no longer supported (pre-Raven 1.x)
- API will now validate data before sending it into the queue, enabling better debugging for clients.

v3.8.0
------

Plugins are now configurable per-project. This makes it easy to install a plugin globally
and allow it to run only on selective projects.

v3.7.0
------

Several minor fixes, as well as a backwards incompatible change with filters.

All filters must now accept the project argument in the initializer. The signature is
now __init__(request, project).

v3.6.0
------

This version focuses on improving membership control. It includes the ability to revoke
project members access temporarily (by suspending them), as well as revoking users
(outside of Sentry) via the user.is_active flag.

Additionally, it brings the beginnings of an "invite user" flow, allowing you to
invite users who may or may not already have accounts in the system. We plan to improve
this flow in an upcoming release to allow invitees easy registration within the system
if they don't already have an account.

v3.5.0
------

Several improvements and additions have been made around the administration, including
performance improvements.

If you're utilizing the queue, the installation guide now recommends you switch off the
database backend, and move to something more efficient (such as Redis).

v3.4.0
------

Eventlet is no longer used as the default worker for gunicorn, and thus is no longer
installed by default. If you're using the udp worker, or ``send_fake_data`` you MUST
install eventlet yourself. The recommended worker class for gunicorn is now ``gevent``
as it corrects some issues with async queries in psycopg2.

v3.3.0
------

The queue has been changed from direct Kombu, to utilizing Celery entirely. If you were
already using the queue, the upgrade simply requires you to change "sentry start worker"
to "sentry celeryd".

v3.0.0
------

Version 3 of Sentry is centered around a restructure of the internal services and
the architecture for running those. It also includes improvements to the plugin architecture.

The upgrade process should be trivial, just be aware that if you were using --config before
you must change the way you pass it so that it's before the subcommand. For example
if you were doing ``sentry start --config...`` the command would now be changed to
``sentry --config... start``.

* Sentry no longer provides the ability to daemonize processes. This should now be
  done at the system level.
* All of Sentry's CLI is now handled through Logan (https://github.com/dcramer/logan),
  which simply pipes commands to Django's internal system utilizing custom configuration.
