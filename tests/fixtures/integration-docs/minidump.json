See the following\nresources for libraries that support generating minidump crash reports:</p>\n<div class=\"toctree-wrapper compound\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toctree-l1\"><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/clients/minidump/breakpad/\">Google Breakpad</a></li>\n<li class=\"toctree-l1\"><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/clients/minidump/crashpad/\">Google Crashpad</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>If you have already integrated a library that generates minidumps and would just\nlike to upload them to Sentry, you need to configure the <em>Minidump Endpoint\nURL</em>, which can be found at <em>Project Settings &gt; Client Keys (DSN)</em>. This\nendpoint expects a <code class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">POST</span></code> request with the minidump in the\n<code class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">upload_file_minidump</span></code> field:</p>\n<div class=\"code shell highlight-python\"><div class=\"highlight\" style=\"background: #ffffff\"><pre style=\"line-height: 125%\"><span></span>$ curl -X POST \\\n  &#39;___MINIDUMP_URL___&#39; \\\n  -F upload_file_minidump=@mini.dmp\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>To send additional information, simply add more form fields to this request.
