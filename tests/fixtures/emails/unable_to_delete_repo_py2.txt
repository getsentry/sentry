Unable to Delete Repo
---------------------

We were unable to delete webhooks in Example for your repository (<em>getsentry/sentry</em>) due to the following error:
An internal server error occurred

You will need to remove these webhooks manually in Example in order to stop sending commit data to Sentry.
