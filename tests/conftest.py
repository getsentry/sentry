    Ensure the deletions on any hybrid cloud foreign keys would be recorded to an outbox
    by preventing any deletes that do not pass through a special 'connection'.

    This logic creates an additional database role which cannot make deletions on special
    restricted hybrid cloud objects, forcing code that would delete it in tests to explicitly
    escalate their role -- the hope being that only codepaths that are smart about outbox
    creation will do so.

    If you are running into issues with permissions to delete objects, consider whether
    you are deleting an object with a hybrid cloud foreign key pointing to it, and whether
    there is an 'expected' way to delete it (usually through the ORM .delete() method, but
    not the QuerySet.delete() or raw SQL delete).

    If you are certain you need to delete the objects in a new codepath, check out User.delete
    logic to see how to escalate the connection's role in tests.  Make absolutely sure that you
    create Outbox objects in the same transaction that matches what you delete.
