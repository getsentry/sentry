Acceptance Tests

An acceptance test is a full end-to-end (frontend and backend) test of a system
designed as real use case scenarios. At Sentry, we test these actions with
Selenium, an automated browser simulator. The advantage of using acceptance
tests rather than unit tests is that they can ensure an entire feature's flow is
functional. The disadvantage is that they can be slow and in some cases flaky.
