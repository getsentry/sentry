# We really should not be using api serializers with the hybrid cloud data classes.
# For instance, if you need to serialize one of these objects, better to do so manually inside of some other serializer
# in general.  A big reason for this is that the hybrid cloud data classes are internal objects that are going to be
# used in an internal API -- they are designed specifically not to be rendered back in our public apis.
# Secondly, there should never be any custom serialization logic -- all of our hybrid cloud objects will be
# serialized and deserialized using narrow, very thin protocol logic, which will not be adhoc written per type.
# If you're unsure how to proceed, ping the project-hybrid-cloud channel to get some assistance.
