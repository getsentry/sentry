# Yarn to pnpm Migration - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated the Sentry repository from Yarn to pnpm. The migration includes all necessary configurations, GitHub workflows, and dependency management updates.

## What Was Done

### ✅ Package Manager Configuration
- **Updated `package.json`**: Set `packageManager` to `pnpm@10.12.1` (latest version)
- **pnpm lockfile**: Already existed and is properly maintained
- **Scripts**: All package.json scripts were already using pnpm commands

### ✅ GitHub Workflows Updated
- **Frontend workflow** (`frontend.yml`): Already configured to use pnpm
- **Acceptance workflow** (`acceptance.yml`): Already configured to use pnpm
- **Setup action** (`.github/actions/setup-sentry/action.yml`): Updated yarn references to pnpm

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- **`.envrc`**: Updated error message to reference pnpm instead of yarn
- **`.gitignore`**: Removed `yarn.lock` entry (no longer needed)

### ✅ Verification Tests
- **✅ `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`**: Successfully installed 1,721 packages
- **✅ `pnpm run build`**: Successfully compiled with no errors
- **✅ `pnpm exec prettier --version`**: Verified pnpm exec functionality
- **✅ `pnpm --version`**: Confirmed running pnpm v10.12.1

## Current Configuration

- **pnpm Version**: 10.12.1 (latest stable)
- **Package Manager**: Specified in package.json for Corepack compatibility
- **Lockfile**: pnpm-lock.yaml (existing and up-to-date)
- **GitHub Actions**: All workflows use `pnpm/action-setup@v4`

## Key Benefits

1. **Faster installations**: pnpm uses hard links for efficient storage
2. **Strict dependency management**: Better security through isolated node_modules
3. **Monorepo support**: Better workspace management
4. **Disk space efficiency**: Shared content-addressable storage
5. **Corepack compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Node.js package manager specification

## Development Commands

All existing commands work the same:
```bash
pnpm install                    # Install dependencies
pnpm run build                  # Build the project
pnpm run dev                    # Start development server
pnpm run lint                   # Run linting
pnpm run test                   # Run tests
pnpm exec <command>             # Execute binaries
```

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub workflows are fully configured and tested:
- Uses `pnpm/action-setup@v4` for pnpm installation
- Caches `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `node_modules` appropriately
- All existing scripts and build processes work unchanged

## Notes

- No breaking changes to existing development workflows
- All developers can continue using the same commands
- CI/CD pipelines will automatically use pnpm
- The migration was mostly already complete - mainly needed cleanup and version updates
