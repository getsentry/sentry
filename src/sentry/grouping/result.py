# XXX(markus): Because of fallback grouping, people who migrate to new grouping
# algorithm will start grouping at the maximum level as for each issue there
# will be likely one old system- or app-hash that matches the max level (=group
# by all frames). That means that the system will produce extremely long tree
# labels even though the user may not really want or understand any of them.
#
# To get around this, we truncate the tree label down to some arbitrary
# number of functions. This does not apply to the grouping breakdown, as in
# grouping_level_new_issues endpoint we populate the tree labels not through
# this function at all.
#
# The reason we do this on the backend instead of the frontend's title
# component is because JIRA/Slack/Email titles suffer from the same issue:
# After the user migrates to hierarchical grouping, all the issue titles are
# really long, and any created JIRA ticket's title/summary is also really long.
#
# Once people are able to actually split up issues (i.e. set the grouping
# level), we may revisit this type of truncation and replace it with something
# that only kicks in when the found hash is found via fallback grouping. But
# that'd be harder to implement and doesn't need to be solved rn.
