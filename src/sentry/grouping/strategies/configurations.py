        * Better rules for when to take context lines into account for
          JavaScript platforms for grouping purposes.
        * Better support for PHP7 anonymous classes.
        * Added new language/platform specific stack trace grouping enhancements rules
          that should make the default grouping experience better.
          This includes JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, Java and Kotlin.
        * Added ChukloadErrors via new built-in fingerprinting support.
