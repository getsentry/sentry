# javascript but works for all platforms.

        * Uses source code information all platforms with reliable sources
          for grouping (JavaScript, Python, PHP and Ruby) and function
          names and filenames otherwise.
        * Fallback grouping applies clean-up logic on exception messages
          (numbers, uuids, email addresses and others are removed)
        * JavaScript stacktraces are better deduplicated across browser
          versions yielding a higher chance of these grouping together.
        * JavaScript stacktraces involving source maps are likely to group
          better.
        * C/C++ and other native stacktraces are more reliably grouped.
