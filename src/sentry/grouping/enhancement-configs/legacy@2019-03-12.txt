# Needed for versions < sentry-cocoa 6.3.0 and static linking.
# Before sentry-cocoa 6.3.0, we marked all packages located inside the application bundle as inApp.
# Since 6.3.0, the Cocoa SKD only marks the main executable as inApp. This change doesn't impact
# applications using static libraries, as when using static libraries, all of them end up in the
# main executable.
