    Create a bespoke Google Cloud Workstation instance.

    NOTE: THIS IS CURRENTLY AN ALPHA STAGE COMMAND! If you are a Sentry dev, you'll need explicit
    permissions from the OSPO team to spin up a workstation. Please reach out to us on
    #discuss-self-hosted - we'd be happy to get you set up! :)

    This command is primarily intended for Sentry employees working on self-hosted. To learn more
    about how to set this up, check out
    https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/workstation/README.md.

    The `workstations` command requires that the `gcloud` command line utility at version >=464.0 be
    installed and visible from its `$PATH`.

    The tool requires two configuration values: a `project` specifying the GCP project that owns the
    desired workstation(s), and a `config` that provisions them with it. These can be set in the
    following ways, listed in order of precedence:

        1. Via flags passed to the requested subcommand, ex: `sentry workstations create my_machine
            --project=my_proj --config=my_config`.

        2. Via `SENTRY_WORKSTATION_`-prefixed environment variables, ex:
           `SENTRY_WORKSTATION_PROJECT=my_proj sentry
            workstations create my_machine --config=my_config`.

    Note that this command will NOT honor your `gcloud config set project` setting - you must use
    one of the two methods described above to set the project.
