        Records the duration of a symbolication request for the given project_id.

        The duration (from the start of the symbolication request)
        should be recorded at regular intervals *as the event is being processed*.

        The duration is used to track the used "symbolication time budget" of a project.
        Each project is allocated a certain per-second budget.
        If that budget is exceeded, the project will be demoted to the low priority queue.

        This can happen when a project either submits *a lot* of fast events,
        or a few *very slow* events.

        As the running duration is recorded at regular intervals,
        it naturally forms a quadratic function:

        Assuming we record at 1-second intervals and the request took 5 seconds
        in total, the used budget is:

        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

        In general, a request that takes n seconds to symbolicate will cost
        1 + 2 + … + n = n * (n+1) / 2 = O(n²) time units.

        This method will "punish" slow events in particular, as our main goal is
        to maintain throughput with limited concurrency.
