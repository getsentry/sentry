    A kind of limiter that limits set cardinality instead of a rate/count.

    The high-level concepts are very similar to `sentry.ratelimits.sliding_windows`.

    Instead of passing in numbers and getting back smaller numbers, however, the
    user passes in a set and gets back a smaller set. Set elements that have
    already been observed in any quota's window are "for free" and will not
    count towards any quota.

    The implementation hasn't been finalized yet, but we expect that under the hood
    this cardinality limiter will be more expensive to operate than a simple rate
    limiter, as it needs to keep track of already-seen set elements. The memory
    usage in Redis will most likely be proportional to the set size.

    This kind of limiter does not support prefix overrides, which practically means
    that there can only be a per-org or a global limit, not both at once.
