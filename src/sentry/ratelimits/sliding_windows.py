"""
The ratelimiter used by the metrics string indexer to rate-limit DB writes.

As opposed to the API rate limiter, a limit in the "sliding window" rate
limiter such as "10 requests / minute" does not reset to 0 every minute.
Instead each window can be configured with a "granularity" setting such that
the window gradually resets in steps of `granularity` seconds.

Additionally this rate-limiter is not coupled to per-project/organization
scopes, and can apply multiple sliding windows at once. On the flipside it is
not strongly consistent and depending on usage it is very easy to over-spend
quota, as checking quota and spending quota are two separate steps.

Example
=======

We want to enforce the number of requests per organization via two limits:

* 100 per 30-second
* 10 per 3-seconds

On every request, our API endpoint calls:

    check_and_use_quotas(RequestedQuota(
        prefix=f"org-id:{org_id}"
        quotas=[
            Quota(
                window_seconds=30,
                limit=100,

                # can be arbitrary depending on how "sliding" the sliding
                # window should be. This one configures per-10-second granularity
                # to make the example simpler
                granularity=10,
            ),
            Quota(
                window_seconds=3,
                limit=10,
                granularity=1,
            )
        ]
    ))

For a request happening at time `900` for `org_id=123`, the redis backend
checks the following keys::

    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:3:900
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:3:899
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:3:898
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:30:90
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:30:89
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:30:88

...none of which exist, so the values are assumed 0 and the request goes
through. It then sets the following keys:

    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:30:90 += 1
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:3:900 += 1

Another request for the same org happens at time `902`.

* The keys starting with `:123:30:` sum up to 1, so the 30-second limit of 100 is not exceeded.
* The keys starting with `:123:3:` sum up to 1, so the 3-second limit of 10 is not exceeded.

This request is granted the minimum allowed from the two requested, in this case that is 9 (3-second limit of 10 - 1 used)

Because no quota is exceeded, the request is granted. If one quota summed up to
100 or 10, respectively, the request would be rejected.

When using the quotas, the keys change as follows:

    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:3:900 = 1
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:3:902 = 1
    sliding-window-rate-limit:123:30:90 = 2

        Why is checking quotas and using quotas two separate implementations?
        Isn't that a time-of-check-time-of-use bug, and allows me to over-spend
        quota when requests are happening concurrently?

        1) It's desirable to first check quotas, then do a potentially fallible
           operation, then consume quotas. This rate limiter is primarily going to
           be used inside of the metrics string indexer to rate-limit database
           writes. What we want to do there is: read DB, check rate limits,
           write to DB, use rate limits.

           If we did it any other way (the obvious one being to read DB,
           check-and-use rate limits, write DB), crashes while writing to the
           database can over-consume quotas. This is not a big problem if those
           crashes are flukes, and especially not a problem if the crashes are
           a result of an overloaded DB.

           It is however a problem in case the consumer is crash-looping, or
           crashing (quickly) for 100% of requests (e.g. due to schema
           mismatches between code and DB that somehow don't surface during the
           DB read). In that case the quotas would be consumed immediately and
           incident recovery would require us to reset all quotas manually (or
           disable rate limiting via some killswitch)

        3) The redis backend (really the only backend we care about) already
           has some consistency problems.

           a) Redis only provides strong consistency and ability to
              check-and-increment counters when all involved keys hit the same
              Redis node. That means that a quota with prefix="org_id:123" can
              only run on a single redis node. It also means that a global
              quota (`prefix="global"`) would have to run on a single
              (unchangeable) redis node to be strongly consistent. That's
              however a problem for scalability.

              There's no obvious way to make global quotas consistent with
              per-org quotas this way, so right now it means that requests
              containing multiple quotas with different `prefixes` cannot be
              checked-and-incremented atomically even if we were to change the
              rate-limiter's interface.

           b) This is easily fixable, but because of the above, we
              currently don't control Redis sharding at all, meaning that even
              keys within a single quota's window will hit different Redis
              node. This also helps further distribute the load internally.

              Since we have given up on atomic check-and-increments in general
              anyway, there's no reason to explicitly control sharding.
