    Implements the digest backend API, backed by Redis.

    Each timeline is modeled as a sorted set, and also maintains a separate key
    that contains the last time the digest was processed (used for scheduling.)

    .. code::

        redis:6379> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE "d:t:mail:p:1" inf -inf WITHSCORES
        1) "433be20b807c4cd49a132de69c0f6c55"
        2) "1444847625"
        3) "0f9d5fe4b5b3400fab85d9a841aa8467"
        4) "1444847625"
        ...

    The timeline contains references to several records, which are stored
    separately, encoded using the codec provided to the backend:

    .. code::

        redis:6379> GET "d:t:mail:p:1:r:433be20b807c4cd49a132de69c0f6c55"
        [ binary content ]

    When the timeline is ready to be digested, the timeline set is renamed,
    creating a digest set (in this case the key would be ``d:t:mail:p:1:d``),
    that represents a snapshot of the timeline contents at that point in time.
    (If the digest set already exists, the timeline contents are instead
    unioned into the digest set and then the timeline is cleared.) This allows
    new records to be added to the timeline that will be processed after the
    next scheduling interval without the risk of data loss due to race
    conditions between the record addition and digest generation and delivery.

    Schedules are modeled as two sorted sets -- one for ``waiting`` items, and
    one for ``ready`` items. Items in the ``waiting`` set are scored by the
    time at which they should be transitioned to the ``ready`` set.  Items in
    the ``ready`` set are scored by the time at which they were scheduled to be
    added to the ``ready`` set. Iterating each set from oldest to newest yields
    the highest priority items for action (moving from the ``waiting`` to
    ``ready`` set, or delivering a digest for the ``waiting`` and ``ready``
    set, respectively.)

    .. code::

        redis:6379> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE "d:s:w" inf -inf WITHSCORES
        1) "mail:p:1"
        2) "1444847638"
