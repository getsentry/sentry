This module is meant to manage the lifecycle of the UsageAccumulator
to record shared resource usage amount.

Since the UsageAccumulator depends on an Arroyo Kafka producer, the
lifecycle is critical as the Threadpool has to be closed upon exit
and the producer needs to be flushed to avoid loosing data.
