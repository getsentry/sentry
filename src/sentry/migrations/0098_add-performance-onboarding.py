    # someone from ops to run manually and monitor.
    # General advice is that if in doubt, mark your migration as `is_dangerous`.
    # Some things you should always mark as dangerous:
    # - Large data migrations. Typically we want these to be run manually by ops so that
    #   they can be monitored. Since data migrations will now hold a transaction open
    #   this is even more important.
    # - Adding columns to highly active tables, even ones that are NULL.

    # This flag is used to decide whether to run this migration in a transaction or not.
    # By default we prefer to run in a transaction, but for migrations where you want
    # to `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` this needs to be set to False. Typically you'll
    # want to create an index concurrently when adding one to an existing table.
