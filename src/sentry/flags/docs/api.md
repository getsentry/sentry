### Create Signing Secret [POST]

Requests from web hook providers can be signed. We use the signing secret to verify the webhook's origin is authentic.

- Request (application/json)

  ```json
  {
    "provider": "launchdarkly",
    "secret": "d41d7d1adced450d9e2eb7f76dde6a04"
  }
  ```

### Delete Signing Secret [DELETE]

Delete a signing secret.

- Response 204

## Webhooks [/organizations/<organization_id_or_slug>/flags/hooks/provider/<provider>/]

### Create Generic Flag Log [POST]

A flag log event must be emitted after every flag definition change which influences a flag's evaluation. Updates to a flag that do not change a flag's evaluation logic do not need to be emitted to this endpoint. We are only concerned with changes which could have influenced behavior.

Sentry does not currently have a concept of disambiguating flag changes by project or environment. Everything is done at the organization level. Flag changes that are duplicated across projects, environments, or other groupings within the provider, must be de-duplicated. To support this, the posted payload sets a "change_id" field for idempotency. In the presence of duplicate ids, only one audit-log record is written in Sentry.

**Data Attributes**

| Column          | Type   | Description                                                    |

| action          | string | Enum of `created`, `updated`, or `deleted`.                    |
| change_id       | number | A 64-bit idempotency token representing a unique change group. |
| created_at      | string | String formatted UTC date time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.           |
| created_by      | object | Created-by object.                                             |
| created_by.id   | string | User identifier which made the change.                         |
| created_by.type | string | Enum of `email`, `id`, or `name`.                              |
| flag            | string | The name of the flag changed.                                  |

### Create Provider-Specific Flag Log [POST]

The shape of the request object varies by provider. The `<provider>` URI parameter informs the server of the shape of the request and it is on the server to handle the provider. The following providers are supported: LaunchDarkly.

Webhooks are signed by their provider. The provider handler must use the secret stored in Sentry to verify the signature of the payload. Failure to do so could lead to unauthorized access.

Any request content-type is acceptable (JSON, XML, binary-formats) so long as the server is capable of decoding the request and mapping it to our object model.
