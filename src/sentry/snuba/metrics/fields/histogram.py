    # The histogram "zoom" function is only there to limit the number of
    # histogram merge states we have to merge in order to get greater accuracy
    # on lower zoom levels. Since the maximum number of histogram buckets in
    # ClickHouse is a constant number (250), any row we can filter out
    # before aggregation is a potential win in accuracy.
    #
    # We do two things:
    #
    # - We throw away any buckets whose maximum value is lower than
    #   histogram_from, as we know there are no values in those buckets that
    #   overlap with our zoom range.
    # - We throw away any buckets whose minimum value is higher than
    #   histogram_to, for the same reason.
    #
    # Note that we may still end up merging histogram states whose min/max
    # bounds are not strictly within the user-defined bounds
    # histogram_from/histogram_to. It is the job of rebucket_histogram to get
    # rid of those extra datapoints in query results.
    #
    # We use `arrayReduce("maxMerge", [max])` where one would typically write
    # `maxMerge(max)`, or maybe `maxMergeArray([max])` This is because
    # ClickHouse appears to have some sort of internal limitation where nested
    # aggregate functions are disallowed even if they would make sense, at the
    # same time ClickHouse doesn't appear to be clever enough to detect this
    # constellation in all cases. The following ClickHouse SQL is invalid:
    #
    #   select histogramMergeIf(histogram_buckets, maxMerge(max) >= 123)
    #
    # yet somehow this is fine:
    #
    #   select histogramMergeIf(histogram_buckets, arrayReduce('maxMerge', [max]) >= 123)
    #
    # We can't put this sort of filter in the where-clause as the metrics API
    # allows for querying histograms alongside other kinds of data, so almost
    # all user-defined filters end up in a -If aggregate function.
