# TODO(ecosystem): Evaluate whether or not this even makes sense as a protocol, or we can just use a typed Callable.
# If there is only one method, and the class usage is just to call a method, the Callable route might make more sense.
# The typing T is also sketchy being in only the return position, and not inherently connected to the provider class.
# The concept of renderers could just be a subset of functionality on the base provider class.
