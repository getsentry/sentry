    Data model represents the aggregate for an entire notification message.
    A notification message must always have the resulting identifier that was sent back if there was no error.
    When there is an error, there will be no identifier to leverage or store.

    If a notification message has an error, the resulting error code and details will be saved.
    This information will then be leveraged to show the user which notifications are consistently failing.
    An example of this would be if a Slack channel no longer exists.

    The data model hold the singular gateway for both Metric, and Issue, Alerts.
    Following the specific data relationship, you should be able to find the specific rule, organization, project, and
    incident or group event that this notification message was enacted.

    If any notification message is in relation to another notification message, you should be able to find the original
    notification message through the parent notification message relation.
