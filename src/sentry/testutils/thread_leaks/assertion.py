"""Utility used to regression-proof our thread-leak fixes.

It turns out due to various indirections, just showing the name and exact
"target" of a thread isn't enough to find where/how it was spawned. This code
does a bit of work to record and show exactly where the Thread came from, which
proved essential when working to fix these things.
