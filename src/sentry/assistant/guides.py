# Guide Schema
# id (text, required): unique id
# cue (text):  The text used to prompt the user to initiate the guide.
# required_targets (list): An empty list will cause the guide to be shown regardless
#                          of page/targets presence.
# steps (list): List of steps

# Step Schema
# title (text, required): Title text. Tone should be active.
# message (text, optional): Message text. Should help illustrate how to do a task, not
#                           just literally what the button does.
# target (text, optional): step is tied to an anchor target. If the anchor doesn't exist,
#                          the step will not be shown. if the anchor exists but is of type
#                         "invisible", it will not be pinged but will be scrolled to.
#                          otherwise the anchor will be pinged and scrolled to. If you'd like
#                          your step to show always or have a step is not tied to a specific
#                          element but you'd still like it to be shown, set this as None.
# guide_type (text, optional): "guide" or "tip" (defaults to guide). If it's a tip, the cue won't
#     be shown, and you should also specify the fields "cta_text" and "cta_link", which would
#     replace the "Was this guide useful" message at the end with the CTA and a dismiss button.
# cta_text (text, conditional): CTA button text on the last step of a tip. Must be present if
#     guide_type = tip.
# cta_link (text, conditional): Where the CTA button points to. Must be present if guide_type = tip.
