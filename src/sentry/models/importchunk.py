    A duplicate of a `ControlImportChunk` saved on the control silo. Unlike other `*Replica` models,
    this replica is NOT generated via outbox synchronization; rather, it is the responsibility of
    the import algorithm to create this duplicate as soon as the RPC call to the control silo
    returns.

    The purpose of this model is to ensure that the `sentry.backup._import()` method, which always
    executes from the region silo and is responsible for orchestrating the entire import, has an
    accurate view of the current import state. For models housed in the region silo, this is simple:
    we just atomically write a `RegionImportChunk` for the models being imported in the local atomic
    transaction. For models housed in the control silo, things get more complex: we must make an RPC
    call and, when writing the models atomically in that silo, create a `ControlImportChunk`. But
    the `ControlImportChunk` only lives in the control silo, creating the possibility of potentially
    racy retrieval calls if the `_import()` orchestrator tries to access it directly.

    To resolve this, as soon as the RPC call returns, we have the orchestrator make its own,
    region-silo housed copy of the `ControlImportChunk`, called `ControlImportChunkReplica`. Thus,
    when importing a control model, we have 3 scenarios:

      1. The model's import failed: no `ControlImportChunk` or `ControlImportChunkReplica` was
         created. The orchestrator may freely retry if it so chooses.
      2. The model's import succeeded, and the RPC returned successfully: both `ControlImportChunk`
         and `ControlImportChunkReplica` were created as identical copies of one another. The
         orchestrator can now use its locally replicated copy, avoiding further network calls.
      3. The model's import succeeded in the control silo, but the RPC did not return successfully
         (the response got lost due to a network error, an exception was thrown after the database
         write occurred, etc): we only have a `ControlImportChunk` in the control silo, but no
         `ControlImportChunkReplica`. When the orchestrator retries what it perceives to be this
         failed model import, the control-side implementation will detect that a
         `ControlImportChunk` for it already exists, and will simply return successfully without
         doing any further work.
