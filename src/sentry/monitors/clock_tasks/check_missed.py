    # happen. This takes advantage of the fact that the current reference time
    # will always be at least a minute after the last expected check-in.

    # Typically `expected_time` and this calculated time should be the same, but
    # there are cases where it may not be:
    #
    #  1. We are guarding against a task having not run for every minute.
    #     If we simply set our mark_failed reference timestamp to the failing
    #     check-ins date_added the `next_checkin` computed in mark_failed may
    #     fall behind if the clock skips, since it will just keep computing
    #     next_checkins from previous check-ins.
    #
    #  2. We are more "correctly" handling checkin_margins that are larger
    #     than the schedule gaps. We want the timeout to be placed when it was
    #     expected, but calculate the next expected check-in from the true
    #     previous expected check-in (which would be some time during the
    #     overlapping margin.)

    # We use the expected_time of the check-in to compute out the schedule.
    # Specifically important for interval where it's a function of some
    # starting time.
