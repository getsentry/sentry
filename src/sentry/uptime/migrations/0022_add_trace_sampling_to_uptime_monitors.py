    # This flag is used to mark that a migration shouldn't be automatically run in production.
    # This should only be used for operations where it's safe to run the migration after your
    # code has deployed. So this should not be used for most operations that alter the schema
    # of a table.
    # Here are some things that make sense to mark as post deployment:
    # - Large data migrations. Typically we want these to be run manually so that they can be
    #   monitored and not block the deploy for a long period of time while they run.
    # - Adding indexes to large tables. Since this can take a long time, we'd generally prefer to
    #   run this outside deployments so that we don't block them. Note that while adding an index
    #   is a schema change, it's completely safe to run the operation after the code has deployed.
    # Once deployed, run these manually via: https://develop.sentry.dev/database-migrations/#migration-deployment
