    """
    Takes a project and valid base url and stores ranking information about it in Redis.

    We use three keys here: A set that stores the list of organizations that have seen urls,
    a sorted set that stores a list of projects ranked by the total number of events with valid hostnames
    that they've seen, and a sorted set of hostnames seen in the project ranked by the number of times
    they've been seen.

    We partition the organizations into buckets determined by `ORGANIZATION_FLUSH_FREQUENCY` and
    `BUCKET_FLUSH_FREQUENCY`. So if the flush frequency is one day, and bucket flush frequency
    is 1 minute, then we'll have 1440 buckets. This allows us to spread the load of
    these checks throughout the day instead of processing them all at the same time.

    We also randomly trim the zset based on `RANKED_TRIM_CHANCE`. This means it can grow
    larger than `RANKED_MAX_SIZE`. That shouldn't cause us problems, and is preferable to
    trimming it on every call.
