Rules apply either before an event gets stored, or immediately after.

Basic actions:

- I want to get notified when [X]
- I want to group events when [X]
- I want to scrub data when [X]

Expanded:

- I want to get notified when an event is first seen
- I want to get notified when an event is marked as a regression
- I want to get notified when the rate of an event increases by [100%]
- I want to get notified when an event has been seen more than [100] times
- I want to get notified when an event matches [conditions]
- I want to group events when an event matches [conditions]

Rules get broken down into two phases:

- An action
- A rule condition

A condition itself may actually be any number of things, but that is determined
by the rule's logic. Each rule condition may be associated with a form.

- [ACTION:I want to get notified when] [RULE:an event is first seen]
- [ACTION:I want to group events when] [RULE:an event matches [FORM]]
