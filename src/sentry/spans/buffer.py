"""
Span buffer is a consumer that takes individual spans from snuba-spans (soon
ingest-spans, anyway, from Relay) and assembles them to segments of this form:

    {"spans": <span1>,<span2>,<span3>}

We have to do this without having such a thing as segment ID:

    span1 = {"span_id": "a...", "parent_span_id": "b..."}
    span2 = {"span_id": "b...", "parent_span_id": "c..."}
    span3 = {"span_id": "c...", "parent_span_id": "d..."}

In other words, spans only know their parent spans' IDs, and the segment should
be assembled according to those relationships and implied transitive ones.

There are a few ways to detect when a span is a root span (aka segment span):

1. It does not have a parent_span_id
2. It has an explicit is_segment_span marker, or some attribute directly on the span.
3. For some time, no span comes in that identifies itself as parent.
4. The parent span exists in another project.

We simplify this set of conditions for the span buffer:

* Relay writes is_segment based on some other attributes for us, so that we don't have to look at N span-local attributes. This simplifies condition 2.
* The span buffer is sharded by project. Therefore, condition 4 is handled by the code for condition 3, although with some delay.

Segments are flushed out to `buffered-spans` topic under two conditions:

* If the segment has a root span, it is flushed out after `span_buffer_root_timeout` seconds of inactivity.
* Otherwise, it is flushed out after `span_buffer_timeout` seconds of inactivity.

Now how does that look like in Redis? For each incoming span, we:

1. Try to figure out what the name of the respective span buffer is (`set_key` in `add-buffer.lua`)
  a. We look up any "redirects" from the span buffer's parent_span_id (hashmap at "span-buf:sr:{project_id:trace_id}") to another key.
  b. Otherwise we use "span-buf:s:{project_id:trace_id}:span_id"
2. Rename any span buffers keyed under the span's own span ID to `set_key`, merging their contents.
3. Add the ingested span's payload to the set under `set_key`.
4. To a "global queue", we write the set's key, sorted by timeout.

Eventually, flushing cronjob looks at that global queue, and removes all timed
out keys from it. Then fetches the sets associated with those keys, and deletes
the sets.

This happens in two steps: Get the to-be-flushed segments in `flush_segments`,
then the consumer produces them, then they are deleted from Redis
(`done_flush_segments`)

On top of this, the global queue is sharded by partition, meaning that each
consumer reads and writes to shards that correspond to its own assigned
partitions. This means that extra care needs to be taken when recreating topics
or using spillover topics, especially when their new partition count is lower
than the original topic.

Glossary for types of keys:

    * span-buf:s:* -- the actual set keys, containing span payloads. Each key contains all data for a segment. The most memory-intensive kind of key.
    * span-buf:q:* -- the priority queue, used to determine which segments are ready to be flushed.
    * span-buf:hrs:* -- simple bool key to flag a segment as "has root span" (HRS)
    * span-buf:sr:* -- redirect mappings so that each incoming span ID can be mapped to the right span-buf:s: set.
