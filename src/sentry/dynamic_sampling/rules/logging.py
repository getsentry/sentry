# This data is stored in-memory for simplicity, however, it introduces a problem because Sentry is running in multiple
# instances without shared memory, therefore we might have different active rules on each instance. This will lead to
# some false positives, that is, rules are logged, but they are not changed. This can happen if a rule is marked as
# active by instance X, and then we receive it in instance Y that didn't see it before.

# If we find that this naive implementation generates too much data, we can always use a shared-memory architecture
# by using Redis for example.
