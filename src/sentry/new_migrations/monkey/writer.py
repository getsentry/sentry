    # General advice is that if in doubt, mark your migration as `is_dangerous`.
    # Some things you should always mark as dangerous:
    # - Adding indexes to large tables. These indexes should be created concurrently,
    #   unfortunately we can't run migrations outside of a transaction until Django
    #   1.10. So until then these should be run manually.
    # - Large data migrations. Typically we want these to be run manually by ops so that
    #   they can be monitored. Since data migrations will now hold a transaction open
    #   this is even more important.
    # - Adding columns to highly active tables, even ones that are NULL.
