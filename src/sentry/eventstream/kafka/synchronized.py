    This class implements a consumer that is can only consume messages that

    The consumer groups that are being "followed" are required to publish
    their offsets to a shared commit log topic. The advancement of the
    offsets for these consumer groups in the commit log topic controls
    whether or not the local consumer is allowed to consume messages from its
    assigned partitions. (This commit log topic works similarly to/was
    inspired by/essentially duplicates the contents of the Kafka built-in
    ``__consumer_offsets`` topic, which seems to be intended to be a private
    API of the Kafka system based on the lack of external documentation.)

    It is important to note that the since the local consumer is only allowed
    to consume messages that have been consumed and committed by all of the
    members of the referenced consumer groups, this consumer can only consume
    messages as fast as the slowest consumer (or in other words, the most
    latent or lagging consumer) for each partition. If one of these consumers
    stops consuming messages entirely, this consumer will also stop making
    progress in those partitions.
