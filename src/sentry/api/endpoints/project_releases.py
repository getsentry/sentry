        Create a new release and/or associate a project with a release.
        Release versions that are the same across multiple projects
        within an Organization will be treated as the same release in Sentry.

        Releases are used by Sentry to improve its error reporting abilities
        by correlating first seen events with the release that might have
        introduced the problem.

        Releases are also necessary for sourcemaps and other debug features
        that require manual upload for functioning well.
