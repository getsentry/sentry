        List a Project's Issues
        ```````````````````````

        Return a list of issues (groups) bound to a project.  All parameters are
        supplied as query string parameters.

        A default query of ``is:unresolved`` is applied. To return results
        with other statuses send an new query value (i.e. ``?query=`` for all
        results).

        The ``statsPeriod`` parameter can be used to select the timeline
        stats which should be present. Possible values are: ``""`` (disable),
        ``"24h"``, ``"14d"``

        :qparam string statsPeriod: an optional stat period (can be one of
                                    ``"24h"``, ``"14d"``, and ``""``).
        :qparam bool shortIdLookup: if this is set to true then short IDs are
                                    looked up by this function as well.  This
                                    can cause the return value of the function
                                    to return an event issue of a different
                                    project which is why this is an opt-in.
                                    Set to `1` to enable.
