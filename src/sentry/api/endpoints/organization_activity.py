        # Postgres decides that the best query plan is to iterate backwards on the datetime index.
        # This means it does something close to a table scan to get the results it wants - this can
        # be the case even for orgs with less than a page of activity rows, and often results in
        # queries that take > 30s, which get killed by stomper.
        # To convince Postgres to use the index on `(project_id, datetime)`, it basically needs to
        # see queries that filter on a single project id and then order by datetime. So we replicate
        # the query for every project and UNION ALL them together to get the candidate set of rows.
        # Then we sort these and return the final result. Convoluted, but it improves the query a
        # lot.
