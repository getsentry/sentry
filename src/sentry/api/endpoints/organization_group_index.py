        Return a list of issues (groups) bound to an organization.  All parameters are
        supplied as query string parameters.

        A default query of ``is:unresolved`` is applied. To return results
        with other statuses send an new query value (i.e. ``?query=`` for all
        results).

        The ``groupStatsPeriod`` parameter can be used to select the timeline
        stats which should be present. Possible values are: '' (disable),
        '24h', '14d'

        The ``statsPeriod`` parameter can be used to select a date window starting
        from now. Ex. ``14d``.

        The ``start`` and ``end`` parameters can be used to select an absolute
        date period to fetch issues from.

                                    ``"24h"``, ``"14d"``, and ``""``).

        :qparam string start:       Beginning date. You must also provide ``end``.
        :qparam string end:         End date. You must also provide ``start``.

                                    looked up by this function as well.  This
