We document it here for older SDKs and users who are still migrating to the [User Feedback Widget](https://docs.sentry.io/product/user-feedback/#user-feedback-widget) or [API](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)(multi-platform). If you are a new user, do not use this endpoint - unless you don't have a JS frontend, and your platform's SDK does not offer a feedback API.*

        Submit and associate user feedback with an issue.

        Feedback must be received by the server no more than 30 minutes after the event was saved.

        Additionally, within 5 minutes of submitting feedback it may also be overwritten. This is useful
        in situations where you may need to retry sending a request due to network failures.

        If feedback is rejected due to a mutability threshold, a 409 status code will be returned.

        Note: Feedback may be submitted with DSN authentication (see auth documentation).
