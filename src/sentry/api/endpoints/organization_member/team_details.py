        This request can return various success codes depending on the context of the team:
        - **`201`**: The member has been successfully added.
        - **`202`**: The member needs permission to join the team and an access request
        has been generated.
        - **`204`**: The member is already on the team.

        If the team is provisioned through an identity provider, the member cannot join the
        team through Sentry.

        Note the permission scopes vary depending on the organization setting `"Open Membership"`
        and the type of authorization token. The following table outlines the accepted scopes.
