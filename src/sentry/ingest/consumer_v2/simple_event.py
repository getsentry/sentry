    Processes a single Kafka Message containing a "simple" Event payload.

    - Decode the Kafka payload which is in msgpack format and has a bit of
      metadata like `type` and `project_id`.
    - Fetch the corresponding Project from cache.
    - Decode the actual event payload which is in JSON format and perform some
      initial loadshedding on it.
