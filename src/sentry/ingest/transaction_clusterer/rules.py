    Why Redis?
    We want to update the rule lifetimes when a transaction has been sanitized

    but Redis is capable of doing so.

    Then, why project options?
    Redis is not a persistent store, and rules should be persistent. As a
    result, at some point the up-to-date lifetimes of rules in Redis must be
    updated and merged back to project options. This operation can't happen too
    frequently, and the task to generate rules meets the criteria and thus is
    responsible for that.
