""" Build a directory tree from URL patterns and merge nodes with many siblings.

For example, a blog project might contain transaction names along the lines of:

/users/my-user-name/posts/2022-01-01-that-one-time-i-did-something

We build a tree that looks like this:

/users
  /my-user-name
    /posts
      /2022-01-01-that-one-time-i-did-something
  /my-user-name2
    /posts
      /2022-12-31-i-did-something-too
  /my-user-name3
    /posts
      /2022-07-15-but-what-about-me
    /settings

As soon as the node /users has reached the threshold of X children, we merge them:

/users
  /*
    /posts
      /2022-01-01-that-one-time-i-did-something
      /2022-12-31-i-did-something-too
      /2022-07-15-but-what-about-me
    /settings

If /posts now also has reached the threshold of X children, those are merged as well:

/users
  /*
    /posts
      *
    /settings

Resulting in the following replacement rules:

/users/*/posts/*/**  # To replace both identifiers
/users/*/**          # For URLs with only one identifier, e.g. /users/*/settings

The replacement rules are interpreted by Relay to match and replace `*`, and to match but ignore `**`.
