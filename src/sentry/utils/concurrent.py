    parameter, which has the same behavior as the parameter of the same name
    for the ``Queue`` constructor.

    All threads are daemon threads and will remain alive until the main thread
    exits. Any items remaining in the queue at this point may not be executed!

    NOTE: This is *not* compatible with the ``concurrent.futures.Executor``
    API! Rather than ``submit`` accepting the function arguments, the function
    must already have the argument values bound (via ``functools.partial`` or
    similar), and ``submit`` passes all additional arguments to ``queue.put``
    to allow controlling whether or not queue insertion should be blocking.
