    This is backend that coordinates and delegates method execution to multiple
    backends. It can be used to route requests to different backends based on
    method arguments, as well as execute the same request against multiple
    backends in parallel for testing backend performance and data consistency.

    The backends are provided as mapping of backend name to configuration
    parameters:

        'redis': {
            'path': 'sentry.tsdb.redis.RedisTSDB',
            'executor': {
                'path': 'sentry.utils.services.ThreadedExecutor',
                'options': {
                    'worker_count': 1,
                },
            },
        },
        'dummy': {
            'path': 'sentry.tsdb.dummy.DummyTSDB',
            'executor': {
                'path': 'sentry.utils.services.ThreadedExecutor',
                'options': {
                    'worker_count': 4,
                },
            },
        },
        # ... etc ...

    The backends used for a method call are determined by a selector function
    which is provided with the current context, the method name (as a string)
    and arguments (in the form returned by ``inspect.getcallargs``) and
    expected to return a list of strings which correspond to names in the
    backend mapping. (This list should contain at least one member.) The first
    item in the result list is considered the "primary backend". The remainder
    of the items in the result list are considered "secondary backends". The
    result value of the primary backend will be the result value of the
    delegated method (to callers, this appears as a synchronous method call.)
    The secondary backends are called asynchronously in the background.  (To
    receive the result values of these method calls, provide a callback_func,
    described below.) If the primary backend name returned by the selector
    function doesn't correspond to any registered backend, the function will
    raise a ``InvalidBackend`` exception.  If any referenced secondary backends
    are not registered names, they will be discarded and logged.

    The members and ordering of the selector function result (and thus the
    primary and secondary backends for a method call) may vary from call to
    call based on the calling arguments or some other state. For example, some
    calls may use a different primary backend based on some piece of global
    state (e.g. some property of a web request), or a secondary backend
    undergoing testing may be included based on the result of a random number
    generator (essentially calling it in the background for a sample of calls.)

    The selector function and callback function can be provided as either:

    - A dotted import path string (``path.to.callable``) that will be
      imported at backend instantiation, or
    - A reference to a callable object.

    Implementation notes:

    - Only method access is delegated to the individual backends. Attribute
      values are returned from the base backend. Only methods that are defined
      on the base backend are eligible for delegation (since these methods are
      considered the public API.)
    - The backend makes no attempt to synchronize common backend option values
      between backends (e.g. TSDB rollup configuration) to ensure equivalency
      of request parameters based on configuration.
    - Each backend is associated with an executor pool which defaults to a
      thread pool implementation unless otherwise specified in the backend
      configuration. If the backend itself is not thread safe (due to socket
      access, etc.), it's recommended to specify a pool size of 1 to ensure
      exclusive access to resources. Each executor is started when the first
      task is submitted.
    - The request is added to the request queue of the primary backend using a
      blocking put. The request is added to the request queue(s) of the
      secondary backend(s) as a non-blocking put (if these queues are full, the
      request is rejected and the future will raise ``Queue.Full`` when
      attempting to retrieve the result.)
    - The ``callback_func`` is called after all futures have completed, either
      successfully or unsuccessfully. The function parameters are:
      - the context,
      - the method name (as a string),
      - the calling arguments (as returned by ``inspect.getcallargs``),
      - the backend names (as returned by the selector function),
      - a list of results (as either a ``Future``, or ``None`` if the backend
        was invalid) of the same length and ordering as the backend names.
