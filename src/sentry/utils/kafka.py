    Introduces a configurable delay to the consumer topic
    subscription and consumer shutdown steps (handled by the

    these steps to occur at certain time "ticks" (for example, at
    every 15 second tick in a minute), we can reduce the number of
    rebalances that are triggered during a deploy. This means
    fewer "stop the world rebalancing" occurrences and more time
    for the consumer group to stabilize and make progress.
