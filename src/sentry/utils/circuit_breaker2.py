class CircuitBreaker:
    """
    A circuit breaker to be used to temporarily block requests to or calls of a service or function
    which is throwing too many errors.

    The breaker has three states: circuit OK, circuit BROKEN, and circuit in RECOVERY. (These states
    respectively correspond to the closed, open, and half-open states of the traditional circuit
    breaker model, but are hopefully easier to keep straight than a model where closed is good and
    open is bad.)

        In a OK state (normal operation), the breaker tracks errors but allows through all requests.
        If the frequency of errors passes a given threshold, it moves to BROKEN state.

        In a BROKEN state, all requests are blocked. Once a set amount of time has passed, it moves
        to RECOVERY state.

        RECOVERY state is identical to OK state, except that the threshold for the circuit breaking
        (moving back into BROKEN state) is much stricter. Once a set amount of time has passed
        without the breaker being tripped, it moves back to OK state.

    The overall idea is to stop hitting a service which seems to be failing, but periodically make
    short attempts to use it in order to be able to resume requests once it comes back up.

    Usage:

    def get_top_dogs(payload):
        # See `CircuitBreakerConfig` class for config options
        breaker = CircuitBreaker(
            settings.SQUIRREL_CHASING_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_KEY,
            options.get("squirrel_chasing.circuit_breaker_config"),
        )

        # Check the state of the breaker before calling the service
        try:
            if breaker.should_allow_request():
                response = call_chase_simulation_service("/hall-of-fame", payload)
            else:
                logger.warning("Request blocked by circuit breaker!")
                return None

        # Call `record_error` only in `except` blocks whose errors should count towards the quota
        except TimeoutError:
            breaker.record_error()
            return "timeout" # or reraise
        except BadInputError:
            return "bad input"
        except Exception:
            breaker.record_error()
            return "unknown error"

        # Call `record_error` for other problems which should count as errors
        if response.status == 500:
            breaker.record_error()
            return f"got {response.status}"

        return format_hof_entries(response)

    The `breaker.should_allow_request()` check can alternatively be used outside of `get_top_dogs`,
    to prevent calls to it. In that case, the circuit breaker must be reinstantiated with the same
    config. This works because the breaker has no state of its own, instead relying on redis-backed
    rate limiters and redis itself to track error count and breaker status.
