IP address: {{ ip_address }}
{% if geo %}
Geolocation: {{ geo.city }}, {{ geo.country_code }}
{% endif %}
Date: {{ datetime|date:"N j, Y, P e" }}

If you have lost your 2FA credentials, you can follow our account recovery steps here:
https://help.sentry.io/account/account-settings/how-do-i-recover-my-account-if-i-lost-my-2fa-credentials/

If these logins are not from you, we recommend you log in to your Sentry account and reset your password under your account security settings:

On the same account security page, we also recommend you click the “Sign out of all devices” button to remove all currently logged-in sessions of your account.
