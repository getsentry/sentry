Performance based alerts just got a lot more accurate
-----------------------------------------------------------

Starting from November 30th, alerts will be based on all the events you send to Sentry, not just the ones that are stored.

How does this affect me, and my team?

Because we're potentially extracting metrics from a significantly larger number of events, existing thresholds could
result in a spammy experience. Instead of waiting until November 30th, we recommend that you take action now by
reviewing the thresholds of each affected alert. This will allow you to migrate alerts ahead of time with the
assurance that they will work as expected.

How do I review my thresholds?

It's pretty simple really, but unfortunately, also pretty tedious (sorry about that)...

We’ve marked all your affected alerts with a "⚠" sign, so that you can quickly identify the ones that need your
attention. In order to perform the review:

- open each rule marked with a "⚠" sign and click “Review Thresholds”
- verify whether current thresholds are still valid or make adjustments as needed
- save the changes to finish the review

To get the ball rolling, we've included a shortlist of alerts that need review below, but click on "View Performance
Alerts" to see the list of affected ones in Sentry.
