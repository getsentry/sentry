    Seems like your team could use some new tools. {{ requester_name }} from
    {{ organization_name }} requested the installation of {{ integration_name }}.
    {% if message %}
        They’ve included some additional context:
        <pre>{{ message }}</pre>
    {% endif %}
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="{{ integration_link }}" class="btn">Install {{ integration_name }}</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re not up for installation, you can
    <a href="{{ requester_link }}">change {{ requester_name }}’s role</a>
    to organization owner, manager, or admin. You can learn more about the
    wonderful world of permissions in
    <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/accounts/membership/">our docs</a>.
