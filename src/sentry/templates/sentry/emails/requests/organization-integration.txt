Seems like your team could use some new tools. {{ requester_name }} from {{ organization_name }} requested the installation of {{ integration_name }}.
{% if message %}
They’ve included some additional context:
    {{ message }}
{% endif %}
Install {{ provider_name }} by clicking the link below:

    {{ provider_link }}

If you’re not up for installation, you can change {{ requester_name }}’s role to organization owner, manager, or admin here: {{ requester_link }}.
You can learn more about the wonderful world of permissions in our docs: https://docs.sentry.io/accounts/membership/.

Let’s get integrated.

You are receiving this email because you’re listed as an organization Owner or Manager.
Requests to join your organization can be disabled in Organization Settings: {{ settings_link }}.
