  {{ requester_name }} told us you’d be interested in Sentry App Monitoring for Mobile.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Why? Well, because Sentry for Mobile shows a holistic overview of your application's health in real-time. So you can correlate errors with releases, tags, and devices to solve problems quickly, decrease churn, and improve user retention.

    {% blocktrans %}
    <strong>See</strong> session data, version adoption, and user impact by every release.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </li>
  <li>
    {% blocktrans %}
    <strong>Solve</strong> issues quickly with full context: contextualized stack traces, events that lead to the error, client, hardware information and the very commit that introduced the error.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </li>
  <li>
    {% blocktrans %}
    <strong>Learn</strong> and analyze event data to reduce regressions and ultimately improve user adoption and engagement.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    And guess what? Set up takes less than five minutes.

    Sorry, but you won’t be able to use “debugging” as an excuse to get out of your second cousin’s Zoom birthday dinner.
