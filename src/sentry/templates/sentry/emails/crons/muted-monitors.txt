Your Cron Monitors Have Been Muted

The Cron Monitors below have not processed a successful check-in for multiple weeks. We have automatically muted the failing environments for these monitors:
{% for monitor_name, monitor_url, earliest_incident_start_date in muted_monitors %}
* {{monitor_name}} {{monitor_url}} | Failing since {{earliest_incident_start_date|date:"N j, Y, g:i:s a e"}}
{% endfor %}

To unmute your monitors, please head over to Crons and manually unmute your monitors.

View Monitors: {{ view_monitors_link }}

Note that muted monitors will still count towards on-demand budget, but can be disabled in order to preserve your on-demand budget for the next billing cycle.

We recommend checking out our troubleshooting guide and our FAQs: "https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/troubleshooting/" for further information on how you can bring your monitors back to a healthy status.
