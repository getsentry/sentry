    <p>Hey there,</p>
    <p>Your teammates at <strong>{{ organization.name }}</strong> are using Sentry to catch errors, improve latency issues, and keep their (and maybe your) code from catching fire. ðŸ”¥</p>

    <p>Looks like they need your help. You've been invited to join them:</p>


<p>ðŸ‘‰ <a href="{{ url }}" class="btn">Accept your invite</a></p>

    <div class="notice">Heads up: this invite link is just for you. Don't share it unless you want random strangers fixing your bugs.</div>

    <p>Oh, and don't forget to try Seer, your new AI debugging agent. It'll automatically pinpoint root causes, suggest fixes, and even predict bugs before they land in prod.</p>

    <p>
        Welcome to the club.<br>
        - The Sentry Team
    </p>
