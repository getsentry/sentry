      A team generally represents a group of people within your organization. It might be something like <strong>"Platform"</strong> or <strong>"API"</strong>, or it could just be a specific product that may (or may not) have sub-projects. You'll be able to select which teams a member in your organization has access to so they also act as ACLs.
