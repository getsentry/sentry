      <p>It looks like you've hit an issue in our server API. Don't worry
        though! We use Sentry to monitor Sentry and it's likely we're already
        looking into this!</p>
      <p>If you're daring, you may want to try the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give it a few seconds and <a onClick="window.location.href = window.location.href">reload the page</a>.</li>
        <li>If all else fails, <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/new/choose">contact us</a> with more details.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
