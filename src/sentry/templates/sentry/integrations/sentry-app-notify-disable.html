    Hi there,
</p><p>
    We’ve received multiple <a href={{dashboard_link}}/>request errors</a> from your webhook: <a href={{webhook_url}}>{{webhook_url}}</a> for the custom {{ integration_name }} integration, and have unsubscribed the webhook from receiving events.
</p><p>
    To continue using your custom integration, please fix your webhook and re-enable the webhook subscriptions <a href={{integration_link}}>here</a>.
</p><p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>If you need additional assistance, you can reach out to our support team at <a href=https://help.sentry.io/>help.sentry.io</a>.</p>
  <p>Happy fixing,</p><p>
    Sentry
