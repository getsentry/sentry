Hi there,

    We’ve received multiple <a href={{dashboard_link}}/>request errors</a> from your webhook: <a href={{webhook_url}}>{{webhook_url}}</a> for the custom {{ integration_name }} integration,
    and have unsubscribed the webhook from receiving events.

    To continue using your custom integration, please fix your webhook: <a href={{webhook_url}}>{{webhook_url}}</a> and re-enable the webhook subscriptions <a href={{integration_link}}>here</a>.

If you need additional assistance, you can reach out to our support team at <a href=https://help.sentry.io/>help.sentry.io</a>.

Happy fixing,
Sentry
