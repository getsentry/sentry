    This will check the number of alertgroup_to_event_data items in the Redis buffer for a project.

    If the number is larger than the batch size, it will chunk the items and process them in batches.

    The batches are replicated into a new redis hash with a unique filter (a uuid) to identify the batch.
    We need to use a UUID because these batches can be created in multiple processes and we need to ensure
    uniqueness across all of them for the centralized redis buffer. The batches are stored in redis because
    we shouldn't pass objects that need to be pickled and 10k items could be problematic in the tasks
    as arguments could be problematic. Finally, we can't use a pagination system on the data because
    redis doesn't maintain the sort order of the hash keys.
