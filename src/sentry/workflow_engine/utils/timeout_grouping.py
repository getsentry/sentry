    Context manager that ensures that ProcessingDeadlineExceeded errors are grouped together on the task level.

    subsequent line of code executed may be running when it is raised.
    Defaulting to grouping by task is more accurate, and where there's a need to subdivide that, we
    offer the ability to refine.
