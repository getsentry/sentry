# Cache #
#########

# Sentry currently utilizes two separate mechanisms. While CACHES is not a
# requirement, it will optimize several high throughput patterns.

# If you wish to use memcached, install the dependencies and adjust the config
# as shown:
#
#   pip install python-memcached
#
# CACHES = {
#     'default': {
#         'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
#         'LOCATION': ['127.0.0.1:11211'],
#     }

# A primary cache is required for things such as processing events

# Queue #

# See https://docs.sentry.io/on-premise/server/queue/ for more
# information on configuring your queue broker and workers. Sentry relies
# on a Python framework called Celery to manage queues.

# Buffers (combined with queueing) act as an intermediate layer between the

# numbers of the same events being sent to the API in a short amount of time.
# (read: if you send any kind of real data to Sentry, you should enable buffers)
