**Note**: This plugin has been deprecated in favor of the `Gitlab Global Integration <https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/gitlab/>`_.

Go to your project's configuration page (Projects -> [Project] -> Issue Tracking) and select
GitLab. Enter the required credentials (use a `personal access
token<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html>`_)
and click save changes.

It's recommended to create a specific user for Sentry with only `Reporter` privileges on your projects.
