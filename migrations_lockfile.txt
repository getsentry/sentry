Django migrations lock file. This helps us avoid migration conflicts on master.
If you have a conflict in this file, it means that someone has committed a migration
ahead of you.

To resolve this, rebase against latest master and regenerate your migration. This file
will then be regenerated, and you should be able to merge without conflicts.
