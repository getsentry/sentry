# Permissions & Scopes

If you're building on top of Sentry's API (i.e using [Auth Tokens](/api/auth/)), you'll need certain scopes to access
different API endpoints.

To set the scopes for an [integration token](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#permissions), select the scopes from the dropdown. These can be edited later.

To set the scopes for an auth token, check the necessary boxes when [creating an auth token](https://sentry.io/api/).
