The `SlideOverPanel` component is a panel that can appear on the right, left, or bottom of the page content to reveal more information. It's commonly used for UIs like the Widget Builder to open panels that provide more details or supplementary UIs.

## Basic Usage

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => setIsPanelOpen(true)}>Open Panel</Button>

<SlideOverPanel collapsed={!isPanelOpen} slidePosition="right">
  <Container border="primary" height="100%" padding="md">
    <Button onClick={() => setIsPanelOpen(false)}>Close Panel</Button>
  </Container>
</SlideOverPanel>
```

> [!NOTE]
> To enable exit animations, you'll need to wrap `<SlideOverPanel />` in an `<AnimatePresence />` component, and render the panel conditionally (e.g., `{isPanelOpen &&}`) instead of using the `collapsed` prop.

## Skeletons

Panels support skeleton UI. This is very useful if the contents of the panel are slow to render. Without a skeleton, the panel won't render until all the contents are ready. With a skeleton, the panel will open right away, and show the skeleton UI while the render is happening.

In the example below, try opening the panel with the skeleton turned off. You'll notice that there's a two-second delay before the panel opens, while it waits for a slow component to render. If you turn the skeleton on, the panel opens immediately and shows a loading state. The slow component appears when it's ready.

<Storybook.Demo>
  <SlideOverPanelSkeletonPlayground />
</Storybook.Demo>

To enable a loading skeleton, provide the `skeleton` prop.

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => setIsPanelOpen(true)}>Open Panel</Button>

<SlideOverPanel collapsed={!isPanelOpen} slidePosition="right" skeleton={<Placeholder />}>
  <Container border="primary" height="100%" padding="md">
    <Button onClick={() => setIsPanelOpen(false)}>Close Panel</Button>
  </Container>
</SlideOverPanel>
```

> [!NOTE]
> To enable skeletons, you _must_ use the `collapsed` prop, rather than conditionally render the panel.
