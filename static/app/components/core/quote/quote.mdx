export {documentation};

The `Quote` component renders a `<blockquote>` element to indicate that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. It provides semantic HTML with proper styling and optional citation support through the `source` prop.

## Basic Usage

A simple quotation without attribution:

<Storybook.Demo>
  <Quote>It’s not a bug; it’s an undocumented feature.</Quote>
</Storybook.Demo>
```jsx
<Quote>It’s not a bug; it’s an undocumented feature.</Quote>
```

## Props

### Source Attribution

The `source` prop accepts an object with optional `author`, `href`, and `label` properties for attribution and citation. These properties are rendered with proper semantic HTML using the `cite` attribute and `<cite>` element.

#### With Author

Provide attribution to a specific person or entity:

<Storybook.Demo>
  <Quote source={{author: 'Developer'}}>It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.</Quote>
</Storybook.Demo>
```jsx
<Quote source={{author: 'Developer'}}>It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.</Quote>
```

#### With Author and Label

Include both the author and additional context about the source:

<Storybook.Demo>
  <Quote source={{author: 'Developer', label: 'in complete denial'}}>
    It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
  </Quote>
</Storybook.Demo>
```jsx
<Quote source={{author: 'Developer', label: 'in complete denial'}}>
  It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
</Quote>
```

#### With URL Reference

The `href` property sets the `cite` attribute on the `<blockquote>` element, providing a machine-readable source reference:

<Storybook.Demo>
  <Quote
    source={{
      author: 'Developer',
      label: 'in complete denial',
      href: 'https://example.com/source',
    }}
  >
    It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
  </Quote>
</Storybook.Demo>
```jsx
<Quote
  source={{
    author: 'Developer',
    label: 'in complete denial',
    href: 'https://example.com/source',
  }}
>
  It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
</Quote>
```

## Accessibility

`<Quote>` uses semantic HTML to ensure quotes are correctly announced by assistive technologies, including the `cite` element for machine-readable source references.
