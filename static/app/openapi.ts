   * Changes between `eventsv2` and `events` include:
   * - Field keys in the response now match the keys in the requested `field` param exactly.
   * - The `meta` object in the response now shows types in the nested `field` object.

   * Aside from the url change, there are no changes to the request payload itself.
   *
   * **Note**: This endpoint is intended to get a table of results, and is not for doing a full export of data sent to
   * Sentry.
   *
   * The `field` query parameter determines what fields will be selected in the `data` and `meta` keys of the endpoint response.
   * - The `data` key contains a list of results row by row that match the `query` made
   * - The `meta` key contains information about the response, including the unit or type of the fields requested
