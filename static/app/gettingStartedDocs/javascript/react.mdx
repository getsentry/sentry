## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/react

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/react
```

## Configure

Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<div className='error-monitoring'>

```javascript
import { createRoot } React from "react-dom/client";
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />)
```

</div>

<div className='replay-and-performance'>

```javascript
import { createRoot } React from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

      // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
      tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Performance Monitoring
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Capture 100% of the transactions, reduce in production!
  // Session Replay
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want to change it to 100% while in development and then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // If you're not already sampling the entire session, change the sample rate to 100% when sampling sessions where errors occur.
