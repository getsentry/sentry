## Frontend guidelines

### Layout and Typography Review Rules

CRITICAL:

- Only warn about newly added calls to styled() and do not warn on PRs that modify existing styled() calls
- If you are suggesting to use a Layout or Typography component, read it's implementation to make sure suggestions conform to the actual implementation - this is super important!
- Use the local-most AGENTS.md as a primary guideline for any code you're reviewing.
