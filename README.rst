Sentry
======

Sentry is a realtime event logging and aggregation platform. At its core, it
specializes in monitoring errors and extracting all the information needed
to do a proper post-mortem without any of the hassle of the standard user
feedback loop.

Sentry is a Server
------------------

The Sentry package, at its core, is just a simple server and web UI. It will
handle authentication clients (such as `Raven <https://github.com/dcramer/raven>`_)
and all of the logic behind storage and aggregation.

That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary implementation is in
Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any language, in
any application.
