Sentry
======

Sentry is a modern error logging and aggregation platform.


Sentry is a Server
------------------

The Sentry package fundamentally is just a simple server and web UI. It will
handle authenticating SDKs (such as `Raven <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python>`_),
all of the logic behind storage and aggregation, and alerting team members.

That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The server is in Python, but it contains
a full API for sending events from any language, in any application.
