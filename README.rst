Sentry
======

Sentry is a modern error logging and aggregation platform.


Sentry is a Server
------------------

The Sentry package fundamentally is just a simple server and web UI. It will
handle authenticating clients (such as `Raven <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python>`_)
and all of the logic behind storage and aggregation.

That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary implementation is in
Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any language, in
any application.
