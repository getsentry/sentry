# This is the .envrc for Sentry, for use with direnv.
# It's responsible for enforcing a standard dev environment by checking as much state as possible, and either performing
# initialization (e.g. activating the venv) or giving recommendations on how to reach the desired state.
# It also sets useful environment variables.
# If you'd like to override or do any custom things, this .envrc will source a .envrc-overrides file at the end.

# XXX: we can't trap bash EXIT, because it'll override direnv's finalizing routines.
#      consequently, using "exit" anywhere will skip this notice from showing.
#      so need to use set -e, and return 1.
