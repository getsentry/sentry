# It's responsible for enforcing a standard dev environment by checking as much state as possible, and either performing
# initialization (e.g. activating the venv) or giving recommendations on how to reach the desired state.
# It also sets useful environment variables.
# If you'd like to override or set any custom environment variables, this .envrc will read a .env file at the end.
