# This workflow generates pytest coverage with the flag --cov-context=test
# This coverage is used as input for Codecov Automated Test Selection (see .github/workflows/codecov_ats.yml)
# However there's a performance toll in running tests with this flag.
# So we will not be running the test suite on every commit
