# TODO(billy): this workflow has not been re-named from `acceptance` because
# Visual Snapshots compares against artifacts from the same workflow name (on main branch)
# We should rename this when we have a more finalized naming scheme.
#
# Also note that this name *MUST* match the filename because GHA
# only provides the workflow name (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)
# and GH APIs only support querying by workflow *FILENAME* (https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/workflows/#get-a-workflow)
