Do you want to ask a question? Are you looking for support? The Sentry message
board is the best place for getting support: https://forum.sentry.io

Also note that the Sentry team has finite resources and priorities that are not
always visible on GitHub. If your issue doesn't align with our priorities it's
unlikely it will be worked on. If we're interested in a particular feature however,
we'll follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail.
