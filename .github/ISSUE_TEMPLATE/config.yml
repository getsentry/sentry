# Ideally we could enable this only for Sentry staff. The reason we enable it
# (vs. linking out to ./new in a contact_link as a hack) is to reduce friction
# for Sentry staff creating issues from project boards, now that that flow
# enforces issue templates. The trade-off is worse reports from non-staff. ðŸ¤·
