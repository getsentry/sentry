# This file is used to declaratively define the sentry repository labels.
#
# XXX: A note on renaming labels, from the documentation of the sync action:
#
# > If a label color or description changes, the same label is updated with the
# > new color or description.
# >
# > If a label name changes, the previous label is deleted by default. Also all
# > existing labels which not listed in manifest will be deleted by default. All
# > issues and PRs that were previously labeled with this label are now
# > unlabeled.
#
# If you want to RENAME a label, without all issues and PRs being unlabeled you
# MUST rename the label in the UI AND merge a PR renaming the label here
# simultaneously.
