# TODO: There are some meta files that we potentially could ignore for both front/backend,
# as well as some configuration files that should trigger both

# For now we can infer that "backend == !frontend"
# We do this because frontend sources are a bit more well defined than backend and
# the scope is a bit smaller. e.g. by simply doing a filter on python files (*.py)
# would miss the django templates
frontend:
  - '**/*.[tj]{s,sx}'
  - '**/*.less'
  - '**/tsconfig*.json'
  - 'yarn.lock'
  - '{package,now,vercel}.json'
  - '.eslint*'
  - 'docs-ui/**'
  - 'src/sentry/static/sentry/**'
  - 'tests/js/**'
