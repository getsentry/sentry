# This script is meant to be sourced by bash, not executed.
# As such, don't use exit, use return.

# This script is purely a python virtualenv bootstrap, not the entire development environment.
# For the entire thing, you should still use make bootstrap.
# Eventually, the goal would be to have an idempotent single script that does
# everything make bootstrap does and more (system dependencies and so on).

# This... doesn't quite work.
# set -e
# trap "echo 'bootstrap FAILED.' && trap - ERR && return" ERR

# So just going to sprinkle returns everywhere.
