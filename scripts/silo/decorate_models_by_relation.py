"""
This is an alternative to add_silo_decorators.py that uses an algorithmic definition of
the silos and aims for 100% coverage. It examines the fields of model classes and
uses a graph traversal algorithm to find all models that point to the `Organization`
model, either directly or through a number of steps. Those models are tagged for the
region silo, and all others for the control silo.

Instructions for use:

1. Commit or stash any Git changes in progress.
2. Update foreign key relationships to identify models in the region silo.
2. From the Sentry project root, do
     ./scripts/silo/decorate_models_by_relation.py
3. Do `git status` or `git diff` to observe the results. Commit if you're happy.
