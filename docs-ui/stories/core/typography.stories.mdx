# Typography

Typography refers to text content that either stands by itself (headings, body text) or is inside another element (buttons, table headers).

We've built Sentry's type system around Rubik - a playful open-source typeface. For code and code-like elements, we use Roboto Mono.

## Type scale

Type scales are hierarchical type systems each consisting of styles like Heading 1, Heading 2, Paragraph, and Button/Label.

Sentry's type scale is based on the Rubik typeface and has been fine-tuned for readability and reusability:

<ScaleTable />

## Styling rules

The type scale above should cover a large majority of use cases. However, if an element requires a custom style outside of the type scale, make sure to follow the rules below.

### Weight

Use Medium (600) for headings, button labels, and elements that need to stand out from the rest of the user interface (for example, table headers).

For all other elements, use Regular (400).

### Size

Use a value from the type scale above, which is also available in `theme.fontSizes`.

Be mindful of the type hierarchy. If the element has low importance, use a smaller size (and a lighter color, like <ColorChip value="gray300" />).

### Line height

For headings and short, single-line text like buttons labels and table headers, use 1.2.

For body text (content that can wrap to multiple lines), use 1.4.

### Letter spacing

For large headings (Heading 1 to Heading 3), remove 0.01em (for Heading 3) to 0.02em (for Heading 1). This makes headings more condensed, thereby reinforcing their high order in the type hierarchy.

For text that is smaller than 16px (with the exception of code and code-like elements), add 0.02em to the letter spacing. This makes the text easier to read.

## OpenType features

### Tabular figures

Numeric characters in Rubik have proportional widths, which make numbers look more even and visually appealing.

However, this can be a problem in large tables with a lot of numbers. Different numbers of the same order of magnitude vary greatly in length, making it harder to compare between them in a long column (see below).

Fortunately, Rubik also supports tabular figures - alternative numeric characters that have consistent spacing and have been optimized for legibility.

<TabularFigureTable />

Use tabular figures inside numeric columns in tables. Add `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;` to elements inside these columns to enable tabular figures.

However, don't use tabular figures outside tables. When there is no need to compare between multiple large numbers, proportional figures are the better choice given their more even appearance.

### Ligatures

Ligatures are special glyphs that replace two or more glyphs in order to better connect them. Common glyph pairs with ligature replacements include ff, fi, and fl.

Without ligatures, the characters are all separate:

<Surface>
  <h1 style={{fontFeatureSettings: "'liga' 0", margin: 0}}>ff, fi, fl</h1>
</Surface>

With ligatures, the characters are connected into a single glyph:

<Surface>
  <h1 style={{margin: 0}}>ff, fi, fl</h1>
</Surface>

Use ligatures whenever possible. Add `font-feature-settings: 'liga'` to the body element to enable ligatures on all text elements.

### Fractions

Rubik also contains special formatting for fractions. Without this formatting, numbers in fractions are just rendered as separate characters:

<Surface>
  <h1 style={{margin: 0}}>1/12</h1>
</Surface>

Fractional formatting shrinks the numbers and connects them with a diagonal slash, forming a proportional, condensed visual block:

<Surface>
  <h1 style={{fontFeatureSettings: "'frac'", margin: 0}}>1/12</h1>
</Surface>

Use fractional formatting whenever possible. This can be enabled by adding `font-feature-settings: 'frac'` to elements containing fractions. But be careful: this also changes the appearance of normal, non-fractional numbers, so only apply it to immediate ancestors of texts with fractions.

## Links

### In a longer sentence

When a link appears inside a longer sentence

<Surface>
  <p>
    like this&nbsp;
    <a href="" target="_blank">
      link to nowhere
    </a>
  </p>
</Surface>

- Use <ColorChip value="blue300" /> as the text color
- Add a solid underline in <ColorChip value="blue100" />
- Don't include any preceding articles (a, the, this, our) in the link
- On hover:
  - Use a pointer cursor (`cursor: pointer`)
  - Change the underline color to <ColorChip value="blue200" />

### On its own

When a link appears on its own and the user likely knows that it's a link given the context, like inside a footer:

<Surface>
  <a href="" target="_blank" className="gray-link">
    Privacy Policy
  </a>
  <br />
  <a href="" target="_blank" className="gray-link">
    Terms of Use
  </a>
</Surface>

- Use <ColorChip value="gray500" />, <ColorChip value="gray400" />, or <ColorChip value="gray300" />, depending on the context
- Don't add any underline
- On hover:
  - Use a pointer cursor (`cursor: pointer`)
  - Add a solid underline in <ColorChip value="gray200" />

---

## Code

Use Roboto Mono in <ColorChip value="gray500" />, <ColorChip value="gray400" />, or <ColorChip value="gray300" /> depending on the placement of the code.

There are two styles for code elements, one for short, single-line elements, and another for longer, multi-line code chunks:

<CodeTable />

These two styles are mostly the same, except for two particular places:

- Line height: multi-line code chunks have a taller line height (2) than single-line code (1.4), for easier code skimming
- Letter spacing: single-line code has reduced letter spacing (-0.02em) to offset Roboto Mono's large default letter spacing, bringing it more in line with non-code elements in Rubik

## Lists

### Unordered

Use solid bullets for the first level, and circle bullets for the second:

<Surface>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Camelus
      <ul>
        <li>Bactrian camel</li>
        <li>Dromedary</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Lama
      <ul>
        <li>Llama</li>
        <li>Alpaca</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</Surface>

Don't add full stop (.) to the end of list items, unless the item contains multiple sentences.

Avoid using custom symbols and icons as bullet characters, as they usually look out of place and distract from the main text content.

### Ordered

Use Arabic numerals for the first level, and lowercase letters for the second:

<Surface>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Camelus
      <ol>
        <li>Bactrian camel</li>
        <li>Dromedary</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Lama
      <ol>
        <li>Llama</li>
        <li>Alpaca</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Surface>

Add a single dot (.) followed by two blank spaces between the counters (1, 2, a, b) and the text content.

Avoid using custom symbols and icons as counters.
