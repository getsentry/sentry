# Colors

Sentry has a flexible, tiered color system that adapts to both light and dark mode. Our color palette consists of neutral grays and 6 accent colors.

---

## Grays

There are 5 shades of gray, ranging from Gray 500 (darkest) to Gray 100 (lightest).

**Gray 300 and above** are accessible foreground colors that conform to [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html). Use them as text and icon colors.

Here are the recommended use cases:

- **Gray 500:** headings, button labels, tags/badges, and alerts.
- **Gray 400:** body text, input values & labels.
- **Gray 300:** input placeholders, inactive/disabled inputs and buttons, chart labels, supplemental and non-essential text
- **Gray 200:** borders around large elements (cards, panels, dialogs, tables).
- **Gray 100:** dividers and borders around small elements (buttons, form inputs).

## Accent colors

Accent colors help shift the user's focus to certain interactive and high-priority elements, like links, buttons, and warning banners.

### Hues

There are 6 hues to choose from. Each has specific connotations:

- **Purple:** brand, current/active/focus state, or new information.
- **Blue:** hyperlink.
- **Green:** success, resolution, approval, availability, or creation.
- **Yellow:** warning, missing, or impeded progress.
- **Red:** fatal error, deletion, or removal.
- **Pink:** new feature or promotion.

### Levels

Each hue comes in 4 levels: 400 (dark), 300 (full opacity), 200 (medium opacity), and 100 (low opacity).

- **The 400 level** is a darkened version of 300. It is useful for hover/active states in already accentuated elements. For example, a button could have a background of Purple 300 in normal state and Purple 400 on hover.
- **The 300 level** has full opacity and serves well as text and icon colors (with the exception of Yellow 300, which does not meet [WCAG's contrast standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)).
- **The 200 level** has medium opacity, useful for borders and dividers.
- **The 100 level** has very low opacity, useful as background fills.

## Accessibility

When it comes to using color, there are two main accessibility concerns: readability and separation.

### Readability

[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) requires that normal text elements have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the background. For large text (at least 16px in size AND in medium/bold weight), the required ratio is lower, at 3:1. This is to ensure a comfortable reading experience in different lighting conditions. [Use this tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to confirm text contrast ratios.

In Sentry's color palette, only Gray 300 and above satisfy the contrast requirement for normal text. This applies to both light and dark mode.

Accent colors in the 300 series, except for Yellow 300, satisfy the contrast requirement for large text.

<DoDont
  doBox={{
    img: {src: require('./contrast-do.svg'), alt: 'Text in Gray 300, 400, and 500'},
    text: 'Use Gray 300 and above for normal text',
  }}
  dontBox={{
    img: {src: require('./contrast-dont.svg'), alt: 'Text in Gray 100 and 200'},
    text: "Use Gray 100 or 200 for normal text, as they don't have the required the contrast levels",
  }}
/>

<DoDont
  doBox={{
    img: {
      src: require('./accent-contrast-do.svg'),
      alt: 'Text in Green 300',
    },
    text: 'Use accent colors in the 300 series (except for Yellow 300) for large text, if needed',
  }}
  dontBox={{
    img: {src: require('./accent-contrast-dont.svg'), alt: 'Text in Green 100 and 200'},
    text: 'Use accent colors in the 100 or 200 series for any text',
  }}
/>

### Separation

Color can be an effective way to visually separate elements in the user interface. However, not all users see color in the same way. Some are color-blind and cannot reliably differentiate one color from another. Some have color filters on their screens, like Night Shift in MacOS. Others are in bright environments with high levels of glare, reducing their ability to see color clearly.

As such, color is an unreliable way to separate elements. Whenever possible, provide additional visual cues like icons, text labels, line type (solid, dashed, dotted),â€¦ to further reinforce the separation.

<DoDont
  doBox={{
    img: {
      src: require('./differentiation-do.svg'),
      alt: 'Solid, dashed, and dotted lines in different colors',
    },
    text: 'Provide additional visual encoding (e.g. line type) besides color to differentiate elements',
  }}
  dontBox={{
    img: {
      src: require('./differentiation-dont.svg'),
      alt: 'Solid lines in different colors',
    },
    text: 'Use color as the only way to differentiate elements',
  }}
/>
