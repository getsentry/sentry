# Xcode CI Analysis - Update to Version 16.4

## Summary
After a comprehensive search through the Sentry repository, **no Xcode configurations or macOS CI runners were found**. All CI infrastructure in this repository uses Ubuntu-based runners.

## Search Results

### GitHub Actions Workflows Analyzed
- All 30+ workflow files in `.github/workflows/` use Ubuntu runners only
- No `macos-*` runner specifications found
- No Xcode version references in any workflow files

### Key Files Checked
- **Frontend workflows**: `frontend.yml`, `acceptance.yml` - Ubuntu only
- **Backend workflows**: `backend.yml`, `migrations.yml` - Ubuntu only  
- **Dispatch workflows**: `getsentry-dispatch.yml` - Triggers backend workflows only
- **Build configurations**: `Makefile`, various config files - No mobile targets
- **Environment setup**: `.envrc` - Contains macOS detection but no CI config

### Mobile/iOS Related Content Found
- Documentation and getting-started guides for iOS SDK integration
- Test fixtures with iOS crash data and stack traces
- Frontend components for displaying iOS-related information
- **No actual CI/build infrastructure for iOS**

## Likely Locations for Xcode CI

The iOS/mobile CI infrastructure is probably located in:

### 1. getsentry Repository
- The dispatch script only triggers backend workflows in getsentry
- Mobile CI likely configured separately in that private repository

### 2. External CI Services
- Bitrise, Xcode Cloud, or other mobile-specific platforms
- CircleCI, AppCenter, or similar services with macOS support

### 3. Manual/Local Processes
- iOS builds might be handled through local development environments
- Release processes could be separate from main CI infrastructure

## Next Steps

To update Xcode to version 16.4:

1. **Access getsentry repository** - Check for mobile CI configurations
2. **Identify external CI services** - Review any third-party mobile CI platforms
3. **Contact mobile/iOS team** - They would know the current infrastructure setup
4. **Search for**:
   - `xcode` version specifications
   - `macos-*` runner configurations  
   - Mobile app build workflows
   - iOS deployment pipelines

## Files That Would Need Updates

Once you locate the iOS CI, look for these patterns to update:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
runs-on: macos-14  # Update to support Xcode 16.4
# or
runs-on: macos-15  # Latest that supports Xcode 16.4

# Xcode version specification
- name: Select Xcode
  run: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_16.4.app/Contents/Developer
```

## Repository Context
This analysis was performed on the main Sentry repository, which appears to be focused on the backend/frontend web application rather than mobile SDK CI/CD infrastructure.
