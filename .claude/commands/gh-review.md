Address feedback and checks in a Pull Request.

We use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to manage pull requests.

Review the status checks for this PR, and identify any failures from them.

If there are no failures, review the PR feedback.

Do NOT assume feedback is valid. You should always verify that the feedback is truthful (the bug is real, for example), and then attempt to address it.
