# Documentation Collection & Monorepo Organization

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory serves as a flexible collection space for miscellaneous documentation and monorepo organization. Use it to store project-specific documents that don't fit neatly into the main rules structure.

## 📂 How to Use This Directory

### Option 1: Miscellaneous Documentation Collection
Store various project documents that need a home:

```
dir-name/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── meeting-notes.md            # Important decisions and discussions
├── troubleshooting-guide.md    # Common issues and solutions  
├── research-notes.md           # Technology evaluations and experiments
├── deployment-checklist.md     # Release and deployment procedures
├── api-documentation.md        # API specifications and examples
└── performance-analysis.md     # Benchmarks and optimization notes
```

### Option 2: Monorepo App Documentation
If you have multiple applications, organize documentation by app:

```
dir-name/
├── README.md                   # This file
├── web-app/                   # Frontend application docs
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── component-library.md
│   └── deployment.md
├── api-server/                # Backend application docs
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── database-schema.md
│   └── api-endpoints.md
├── mobile-app/               # Mobile application docs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── build-process.md
└── shared-components/        # Shared library docs
    ├── README.md
    └── usage-guide.md
```

### Option 3: Domain-Specific Organization
Organize by business domain or feature area:

```
dir-name/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── authentication/          # Auth-related documentation
│   ├── oauth-setup.md
│   └── security-policies.md
├── payment-processing/      # Payment-related docs
│   ├── stripe-integration.md
│   └── webhook-handling.md
├── user-management/         # User-related documentation
│   ├── user-roles.md
│   └── profile-management.md
└── analytics/               # Analytics and tracking docs
    ├── event-tracking.md
    └── reporting-setup.md
```

## 🔧 Best Practices

### File Organization
- **Use descriptive names** - Make file purposes clear from the filename
- **Group related docs** - Keep similar documents in subdirectories
- **Maintain a README** - Each subdirectory should have its own README
- **Link between docs** - Create navigation between related documents

### Naming Conventions
```
# Use kebab-case for files
troubleshooting-guide.md
api-documentation.md
deployment-checklist.md

# Use clear, descriptive names
user-authentication.md          # Not: auth.md
database-migration-guide.md     # Not: db.md
third-party-integrations.md     # Not: integrations.md
```
