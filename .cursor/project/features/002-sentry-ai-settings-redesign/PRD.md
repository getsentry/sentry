# Sentry AI Settings Redesign - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## üìã Overview

**Feature Name:** Sentry AI Settings Redesign
**Product Area:** Sentry Organization & Project Settings
**Priority:** High
**Est. Development Time:** 6 weeks
**Target Release:** Q1 2024

### Executive Summary

This feature redesigns Sentry's AI settings interface to eliminate user confusion around "automation" terminology, consolidate scattered settings into a logical hierarchy, and provide a unified experience for configuring Seer AI capabilities across organizations and projects.

## üéØ Objectives

### Problem Statement

Current Sentry AI settings suffer from:

- Confusing "automation" terminology that's overloaded across the product
- Split settings between organization and project levels causing navigation friction
- Missing organization-level "stopping point" configuration
- Distracting info boxes that sandwich important settings
- Unclear distinction between scanning and fixing capabilities
- Difficult project-level repository configuration workflow

### Solution Overview

Create a unified AI settings interface with:

- Organization-level defaults with clear project override capabilities
- Simplified, clear terminology avoiding "automation" overload
- Inline project configuration with expandable controls
- Repository and branch management directly from the organization view
- Complete organization-level stopping point configuration
- Advanced settings hidden by default for cleaner experience

### Success Criteria

- 60% reduction in settings configuration time
- 25% increase in AI feature adoption within 90 days
- 40% decrease in support tickets related to AI configuration
- 85% user satisfaction score for AI settings experience
- 90% of users can configure AI settings without support documentation

## üë• Target Users

### Primary Users

- **Engineering Managers:** Need to set organization-wide AI policies and defaults
- **DevOps Engineers:** Configure AI settings for multiple projects and repositories
- **Technical Leads:** Override organization defaults for specific projects

### Secondary Users

- **Support Team:** Reduced configuration support burden
- **Product Team:** Better AI feature adoption metrics
- **Security Teams:** Clear visibility into AI fix approval workflows

## üìù User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. **As an engineering manager**, I want to set AI scanning and fixing defaults for my entire organization so that new projects inherit sensible configurations
2. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to configure repository settings for multiple projects from one interface so that I don't need to navigate between many pages
3. **As a technical lead**, I want to override organization defaults for my specific project so that I can customize AI behavior for my team's needs
4. **As a user**, I want clear terminology that explains what AI will scan vs. fix so that I understand what actions will be taken

### Edge Cases

1. **As an organization admin**, when I have 50+ projects, I should be able to bulk configure or filter projects efficiently
2. **As a user**, if AI settings conflict between org and project levels, I should see clear indicators of what's overridden
3. **As a new user**, when I enable AI features, I should understand the implications without reading documentation
