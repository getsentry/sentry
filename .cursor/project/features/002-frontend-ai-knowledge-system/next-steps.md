# Next Steps: Frontend AI Knowledge System

## üéØ Project Status Overview

This project addresses three critical needs for improving AI model understanding of the Sentry monorepo:

### ‚úÖ Completed Work

- **PRFAQ.md** - Problem validation and solution approach
- **PRD.md** - Comprehensive technical requirements and implementation plan

### üéØ Three Focus Areas Addressed

**1. Better Developer Documentation References**

- Integration with https://develop.sentry.dev/frontend/ (PRD Section 3.1)
- Integration with https://brand.getsentry.com (PRD Section 3.2)
- Structured references in cursor rules for architecture, testing, and contribution guidelines

**2. Enhanced Cursor Rules with Frontend Context**

- `ui-architecture.mdc` - React 18 + TypeScript patterns, MobX store patterns, routing/navigation
- `design-system.mdc` - Component library, design tokens, accessibility standards
- `frontend-patterns.mdc` - Common UI patterns, form handling, list management

**3. AI-Optimized Frontend Structure**

- Enhanced `static/app/stories/` system with AI-readable documentation
- JSDoc standards for component discovery
- Usage examples and real-world implementation patterns

## üìã Missing Documents

According to the established workflow, we still need:

1. **GTM.md** - Go-to-market strategy for rolling out enhanced AI documentation
2. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Technical implementation details and PR descriptions

## üöÄ Implementation Plan (8 weeks, 4 phases)

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Foundation - Create `ui-architecture.mdc`
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Design System Documentation - Create `design-system.mdc`
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Pattern Documentation - Create `frontend-patterns.mdc`
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Integration & Testing - External docs integration

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Technical Validation

- Component reuse rate in AI suggestions: >75%
- Brand guideline compliance: 100%
- TypeScript compilation success: 100%
- Accessibility audit pass rate: >90%

### Quality Goals

- 90% AI-generated components pass visual review on first attempt
- 50% reduction in UI polish time
- 100% core UI pattern coverage
- Zero brand violations

## ü§î Recommended Next Actions

### Option A: Complete Planning Phase

- [ ] Create **GTM.md** for launch strategy
- [ ] Create **IMPLEMENTATION.md** with technical implementation details
- [ ] Refine success criteria based on current frontend state

### Option B: Start Implementation (Phase 1)

- [ ] Begin with `ui-architecture.mdc` creation
- [ ] Audit current component patterns in `static/app/`
- [ ] Document MobX store patterns and routing structure

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

- [ ] Create IMPLEMENTATION.md for immediate technical clarity
- [ ] Start Phase 1 implementation in parallel
- [ ] Complete GTM.md before Phase 4 (external integration)

## üîç Key Implementation Priorities

1. **React/TypeScript Architecture** - Document current patterns in `static/app/`
2. **MobX Store Patterns** - Extract common state management patterns
3. **Component Library** - Enhance existing `stories/` system
4. **Design System Integration** - Extract tokens from brand guidelines
5. **External Documentation** - Link to develop.sentry.dev and brand.getsentry.com

## üìä Risk Mitigation Focus

- **Documentation Maintenance** - Tie updates to component library changes
- **AI Context Overload** - Prioritize most commonly used patterns
- **Brand Compliance** - Create validation checks for design standards

---

## üí° Recommendation

**Start with Option B** - Begin Phase 1 implementation while the problem context is fresh. The planning documents provide sufficient direction to start creating `ui-architecture.mdc` and auditing existing frontend patterns.

This approach delivers immediate value while allowing the GTM strategy to be refined based on early implementation learnings.
