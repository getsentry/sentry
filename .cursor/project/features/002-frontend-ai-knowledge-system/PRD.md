# PRD: Frontend AI Knowledge System

## Overview

This document outlines the technical requirements for implementing a comprehensive Frontend AI Knowledge System that provides AI agents with deep context about Sentry's frontend architecture, components, and design patterns.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Cursor Rules

#### 1.1 UI Architecture Guide (`ui-architecture.mdc`)

**Purpose**: Provide AI agents with comprehensive understanding of Sentry's frontend structure

**Requirements**:

- Document React 18 + TypeScript architecture patterns
- Explain MobX store organization and state management
- Detail routing structure using React Router
- Describe error boundary patterns and performance optimization
- Map key directories in `static/app/` with their purposes
- Include component lifecycle and data flow patterns

**Implementation**:

```markdown
# Contents will include:

- App structure overview (routes.tsx, components/, stores/, etc.)
- MobX store patterns used throughout Sentry
- Component organization and naming conventions
- Performance patterns (lazy loading, memoization)
- Error handling and boundary patterns
```

#### 1.2 Design System Guide (`design-system.mdc`)

**Purpose**: Enable AI to understand and apply Sentry's design system consistently

**Requirements**:

- Document core components from `static/app/components/`
- Extract key design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Reference brand.getsentry.com guidelines
- Include component usage patterns and variations
- Provide examples of proper component composition

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// Example component documentation pattern
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  // Usage: Primary for main actions, secondary for supporting actions
}

// Common patterns:
// - Use Panel for content containers
// - Use Badge for status indicators
// - Use DropdownButton for action menus
```

#### 1.3 Frontend Patterns Guide (`frontend-patterns.mdc`)

**Purpose**: Document established patterns for common UI scenarios

**Requirements**:

- List management patterns (IssueList, OrganizationList, etc.)
- Form patterns with validation and error handling
- Modal and drawer patterns
- Filter and search patterns
- Loading states and empty state patterns
- Navigation and breadcrumb patterns

### 2. Stories System Enhancement

#### 2.1 AI-Optimized Story Structure

**Current State**: `static/app/stories/` contains basic storybook setup
**Target State**: Rich, AI-consumable component documentation

**Requirements**:

- Enhance existing stories with comprehensive usage examples
- Add JSDoc comments explaining component purpose and usage
- Include common composition patterns in stories
- Document component variants and their use cases
- Add accessibility and performance notes

**Implementation Example**:

```typescript
// static/app/stories/button.stories.tsx
/**
 * Button component - Primary interface element for user actions
 *
 * Usage patterns:
 * - Primary: Main call-to-action (Save, Create, Submit)
 * - Secondary: Supporting actions (Cancel, Reset)
 * - Danger: Destructive actions (Delete, Remove)
 *
 * Accessibility: Always include meaningful aria-label for icon-only buttons
 * Performance: Automatically includes loading states for async actions
 */
export const ButtonStories = {
  Primary: () => <Button variant="primary">Save Changes</Button>,
  // ... more examples with usage context
};
```

#### 2.2 Component Discovery System

**Purpose**: Help AI agents find and understand component relationships

**Requirements**:

- Create component catalog with categories and tags
- Document component dependencies and composition patterns
- Include real-world usage examples from codebase
- Map components to their common use cases

### 3. External Documentation Integration

#### 3.1 Developer Documentation References

**Target**: https://develop.sentry.dev/frontend/

**Requirements**:

- Identify high-value frontend documentation pages
- Create structured references in cursor rules
- Focus on architecture, testing, and contribution guidelines
- Include links to specific guides for common patterns

**Priority Documentation**:

- Frontend architecture overview
- Component development guidelines
- Testing strategies and patterns
- Performance optimization guides
- Accessibility requirements

#### 3.2 Brand Guidelines Integration

**Target**: https://brand.getsentry.com

**Requirements**:

- Extract core design tokens into AI-readable format
- Reference comprehensive brand guidelines externally
- Document color palette with semantic meanings
- Include typography scale and usage guidelines
- Specify spacing system and layout principles

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// Design tokens extracted for AI reference
const SENTRY_DESIGN_TOKENS = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#6C5CE7',
    success: '#00D924',
    warning: '#FFC107',
    error: '#E03E2F',
    // Semantic usage: primary for CTAs, success for confirmations
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: '4px',
    sm: '8px',
    md: '16px',
    lg: '24px',
    xl: '32px',
    // Usage: xs for tight spacing, md for standard, xl for sections
  },
};
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Documentation Maintenance
**Risk**: Documentation becomes outdated as frontend evolves
**Mitigation**:
- Establish update workflow tied to component library changes
- Create automated validation checks for component examples
- Assign documentation ownership to component maintainers

### AI Context Overload
**Risk**: Too much context reduces AI performance
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize most commonly used patterns and components
- Use progressive disclosure in documentation
