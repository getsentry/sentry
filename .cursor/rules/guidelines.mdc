## üîß Common Development Patterns

### Django Backend
```python
# Model with proper indexes and constraints
class Group(Model):
    project = FlexibleForeignKey('sentry.Project')
    status = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0, db_index=True)
    times_seen = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=1, db_index=True)
    last_seen = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now, db_index=True)

    class Meta:
        index_together = (
            ('project', 'status'),
            ('project', 'last_seen'),
        )
```

### React Frontend
```typescript
// Component with error boundary and loading states
const IssueDetails = observer(({issueId}: {issueId: string}) => {
  const {data: issue, loading, error} = useApi<Issue>(`/issues/${issueId}/`);

  if (loading) return <LoadingIndicator />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
  if (!issue) return <NotFound />;

  return <IssueDetailsContent issue={issue} />;
});
```

### Database Optimization
```python
# Efficient queries with select_related and prefetch_related
queryset = Group.objects.select_related('project', 'assignee') \
    .prefetch_related('tags', 'events') \
    .filter(project__organization=org)
```

### Background Tasks
```python
# Celery task with proper error handling and retries
@app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
def process_event(self, event_id):
    try:
        event = Event.objects.get(id=event_id)
        # Process the event
    except Event.DoesNotExist:
        logger.warning(f'Event {event_id} not found')
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Error processing event')
        self.retry(countdown=60)
```

## üí° Remember

This is a mission-critical system that handles sensitive data for thousands of organizations. Every change should be:
- **Thoroughly tested** with comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance-conscious** considering scale and load
- **Security-aware** protecting sensitive information
- **Reliable** maintaining high availability and data integrity
- **Well-documented** for future maintenance and debugging

The Sentry platform is trusted by developers worldwide to monitor their applications. Maintain that trust through careful, thoughtful engineering.

## üîß Development Workflow

### Recommended Development Approach

#### Frontend-Only Changes (Fastest - Use This First)
```bash
# For UI/React changes only
pnpm dev-ui                  # Dev server at https://dev.getsentry.net:7999
                            # Proxies API requests to production
                            # Login with Sentry.io email/password
```

**When to use:**
- React component changes
- CSS/styling updates
- TypeScript interface changes
- Frontend logic modifications
- UI/UX improvements

#### Backend Changes with Production Frontend
```bash
# Configure once in ~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py:
# STATIC_URL = "https://sentry.io/_static/{version}"
# STATIC_FRONTEND_APP_URL = "https://sentry.io/_static/dist/"

sentry run web              # Backend at localhost:9001
```

**When to use:**
- Django model changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Backend logic updates
- Database schema changes

#### Full Stack Development (Slowest - Only When Necessary)
```bash
# Only when making coordinated frontend + backend changes
sentry devserver            # Full local development
```

**When to use:**
- New API endpoints with frontend integration
- Database changes requiring frontend updates
- Complex feature development spanning both layers

### Service Management

#### Essential Services
```bash
# Start required services
sentry devservices up       # Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse

# Background processing (start as needed)
sentry run worker           # Celery workers
sentry run consumer         # Kafka consumers
sentry run cron            # Scheduled tasks
```

#### Database Operations
```bash
# Initial setup
sentry upgrade              # Run migrations
sentry createuser          # Create superuser

# Development operations
sentry repair              # Fix database issues
sentry shell               # Django shell
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
pnpm test                  # Run all frontend tests
pnpm test:watch           # Watch mode for active development
pnpm lint                 # ESLint and TypeScript checking
pnpm lint:fix             # Auto-fix linting issues
```

#### Backend Testing
```bash
pytest tests/             # All backend tests
pytest tests/sentry/api/  # API tests only
pytest -k "test_name"     # Specific test pattern
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Python formatting and linting
black src/                # Format Python code
flake8 src/               # Python linting
mypy src/                 # Type checking

# JavaScript/TypeScript
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm type-check          # TypeScript compilation
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Development Performance
1. **Use `pnpm dev-ui` for frontend changes** - Fastest feedback loop
2. **Minimize full stack development** - Only when necessary
3. **Use production API data** - More realistic development experience
4. **Leverage hot reloading** - Both frontend and backend support it

#### Production Performance
1. **Bundle optimization** - Code splitting and lazy loading
2. **Database optimization** - Proper indexes and query optimization
3. **Caching strategies** - Redis for sessions, query results
4. **Asset optimization** - Minification, compression, CDN


> üí° **For implementation guidance**, refer to specific documentation files. For new features, start with templates in `project/features/001-template/`. This persona ensures development aligned with business needs while maintaining technical excellence.

- Backend logic updates
- Database schema changes

#### Full Stack Development (Slowest - Only When Necessary)
```bash
# Only when making coordinated frontend + backend changes
sentry devserver            # Full local development
```

**When to use:**
- New API endpoints with frontend integration
- Database changes requiring frontend updates
- Complex feature development spanning both layers

### Service Management

#### Essential Services
```bash
# Start required services
sentry devservices up       # Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse

# Background processing (start as needed)
sentry run worker           # Celery workers
sentry run consumer         # Kafka consumers
sentry run cron            # Scheduled tasks
```

#### Database Operations
```bash
# Initial setup
sentry upgrade              # Run migrations
sentry createuser          # Create superuser

# Development operations
sentry repair              # Fix database issues
sentry shell               # Django shell
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
pnpm test                  # Run all frontend tests
pnpm test:watch           # Watch mode for active development
pnpm lint                 # ESLint and TypeScript checking
pnpm lint:fix             # Auto-fix linting issues
```

#### Backend Testing
```bash
pytest tests/             # All backend tests
pytest tests/sentry/api/  # API tests only
pytest -k "test_name"     # Specific test pattern
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Python formatting and linting
black src/                # Format Python code
flake8 src/               # Python linting
mypy src/                 # Type checking

# JavaScript/TypeScript
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm type-check          # TypeScript compilation
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Development Performance
1. **Use `pnpm dev-ui` for frontend changes** - Fastest feedback loop
2. **Minimize full stack development** - Only when necessary
3. **Use production API data** - More realistic development experience
4. **Leverage hot reloading** - Both frontend and backend support it

#### Production Performance
1. **Bundle optimization** - Code splitting and lazy loading
2. **Database optimization** - Proper indexes and query optimization
3. **Caching strategies** - Redis for sessions, query results
4. **Asset optimization** - Minification, compression, CDN
