# Python Environment

**ALWAYS activate the virtualenv before any Python operation**: Before running any Python command (e.g. `python -c`), Python package (e.g. `pytest`, `mypy`), or Python script, you MUST first activate the virtualenv with `source .venv/bin/activate`. This applies to ALL Python operations without exception.

# Python typing

## Recommended practices

For function signatures, always use abstract types (e.g. `Sequence` over `list`) for input parameters and use specific return types (e.g. `list` over `Sequence`).

```python
# Good: Abstract input types, specific return types
def process_items(items: Sequence[Item]) -> list[ProcessedItem]:
    return [process(item) for item in items]

# Avoid: Specific input types, abstract return types
def process_items(items: list[Item]) -> Sequence[ProcessedItem]:
    return [process(item) for item in items]
```

Always import a type from the module `collections.abc` rather than the `typing` module if it is available (e.g. `from collections.abc import Sequence` rather than `from typing import Sequence`).

# Python tests

## Running tests

Always run pytest with these parameters: `pytest -svv --reuse-db` since it is faster to execute.

## How to determine where to add new test cases

When fixing errors or adding functionality, you MUST add test cases to existing test files rather than creating new test files. Follow this pattern to locate the correct test file:

- Code location: `src/sentry/foo/bar.py`
- Test location: `tests/sentry/foo/test_bar.py`

Notice that we prefix `tests/` to the path and prefix `test_` to the module name.

**Exception**: Tests ensuring Snuba compatibility MUST be placed in `tests/snuba/` to run in Snuba's CI process. The tests in this folder will also run in Snuba's CI.


## Use factories instead of directly calling `Model.objects.create`

In Sentry Python tests, you MUST use factory methods in this priority order:
1. Fixture methods (e.g., `self.create_model`) from base classes like `sentry.testutils.fixtures.Fixtures`
2. Factory methods from `sentry.testutils.factories.Factories` when fixtures aren't available

NEVER directly call `Model.objects.create` - this violates our testing standards and bypasses shared test setup logic.

For example, a diff that uses a fixture instead of directly calling `Model.objects.create` would look like:

```diff
    -        direct_project = Project.objects.create(
    -            organization=self.organization,
    -            name="Directly Created",
    -            slug="directly-created"
    -        )
    +        direct_project = self.create_project(
    +            organization=self.organization,
    +            name="Directly Created",
    +            slug="directly-created" # Note: Ensure factory args match
    +        )
```

## Use `pytest` instead of `unittest`

In Sentry Python tests, always use `pytest` instead of `unittest`. This promotes consistency, reduces boilerplate, and leverages shared test setup logic defined in the factories.

For example, a diff that uses `pytest` instead of `unittest` would look like:

```diff
    -        self.assertRaises(ValueError, EffectiveGrantStatus.from_cache, None)
    +        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
    +            EffectiveGrantStatus.from_cache(None)
```

# Rule Enforcement

These rules are MANDATORY for all Python development in the Sentry codebase. Violations will:
- Cause CI failures
- Require code review rejection
- Must be fixed before merge approval

Agents MUST follow these rules without exception to maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
