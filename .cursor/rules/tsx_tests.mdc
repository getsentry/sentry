# TSX Tests and React Testing

## Available Rule Files

This workspace has several rule files available to provide specific guidance:

- **python_tests**: Guidelines for writing Python tests
- **tsx_tests**: Rules and guidelines for running *.spec.tsx tests and writing React tests (this file)

For information about adding new tools, prompts, or extending these guidelines, consult the team leads or refer to the workspace documentation.

# Running *.spec.tsx tests

Please run tests with command: CI=true pnpm test
For example: CI=true pnpm test path/to/file.spec.tsx

NOTE: `CI=true` runs jest in non-interactive mode.

# React tests

When writing React tests and using react-test-library, please use exports from 'sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary'. It re-exports from '@testing-library/react'. For example:

```
import {
  render,
  screen,
  userEvent,
  waitFor,
  within,
} from 'sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary';
```
