# Running *.spec.tsx tests

Please run tests with command: CI=true pnpm test
For example: CI=true pnpm test path/to/file.spec.tsx

NOTE: `CI=true` runs jest in non-interactive mode.

# React tests

When writing React tests and using react-test-library, please use exports from 'sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary'. It re-exports from '@testing-library/react'. For example:

```
import {
  render,
  screen,
  userEvent,
  waitFor,
  within,
} from 'sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary';
```
