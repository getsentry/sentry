Command Line Usage
==================

Sentry installs a command line script under the name ``sentry``. This will allow you to
perform most required operations that are unachievable within the web UI.

For a list of commands, you can also use ``sentry help``, or ``sentry [command] --help``
for help on a specific command.

.. note:: The script is powered by a library called `Logan <https://github.com/dcramer/logan>`_
          and simply acts as a conduit to django-admin.py.

Builtin Commands
