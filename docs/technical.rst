Integration with Sentry
=======================

This page describes various internals of Sentry, as well as the client's storage API.

API
---

If you wish to access Sentry within your own views and models, you may do so via the standard model API::

	from sentry.models import Message, GroupedMessage
	
	# Pull the last 10 unresolved errors.
	GroupedMessage.objects.filter(status=0).order_by('-last_seen')[0:10]

You can also record errors outside of handler if you want::

	from sentry.client.models import client
	
	try:
	    ...
	except Exception, exc:
	    message_id = client.create_from_exception([exc_info=None, url=None, view=None])

If you wish to log normal messages (useful for non-``logging`` integration)::

	from sentry.client.models import client
	import logging
	
	message_id = client.create_from_text('Message Message', level=logging.WARNING, url=None)

Both the ``url`` and ``level`` parameters are optional. ``level`` should be one of the following:

* ``logging.DEBUG``
* ``logging.INFO``
* ``logging.WARNING``
* ``logging.ERROR``
* ``logging.FATAL``

If you have a custom exception class, similar to Http404, or something else you don't want to log,
you can also add ``skip_sentry = True`` to your exception class or instance, and Sentry will simply ignore
the error.

Writing a sentry client
-----------------------

*work in progress!*

This section describes how to write a Sentry client.  As far as the
writer is concerned, a Sentry client *is* a logging handler written in
a language different than Python.  You will not find the
implementation details of a specific Sentry logging handler, since these are
language dependent, but a description of the steps that are needed to
implement just a Sentry client in your own language or framework.

In general, the action taken by a logging handler compatible with
``log4j`` and ``logging`` is doing something with a timestamped
attributable formatted logging record.  Every logging record has its
own severity level.  

:timestamped: ``timestamp`` is the time when the logging record has been produced.
:attributable: ``logger``, the name of the logger that produced the record.
:formatted: the logger has combined all logging record properties into one string: the logging ``message``.
:severityÂ level: ``level`` is a numeric property.

On top of these, Sentry requires the logger to report the ``view``,
the name of the function that has caused the logging record.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A logging handler integrating with Sentry sends the records it handles
to the Sentry server.  The server listens for JSON POST requests,
with the following structure::

    POST /store/
    <the encoded record>

You must also send along the following authentication headers::

    Authorization: Sentry sentry_signature=<hmac signature>,
    sentry_timestamp=<signature timestamp>,
    sentry_version=<client version, arbitrary>

The header is composed of a SHA1-signed HMAC, the timestamp from when the message
was generated, and an arbitrary client version string. The client version should
be something distinct to your client, and is simply for reporting purposes.

To generate the HMAC signature, take the following example (in Python)::

    hmac.new(SENTRY_KEY, '%s %s' % (timestamp, message), hashlib.sha1).hexdigest()

The variables which are required within the signing of the message consist of the following:

- The ``SENTRY_KEY`` is a the shared secret key between client and server. 
- ``timestamp`` is the timestamp of which this message was generated
- ``message`` is the encoded :ref:`POST Body`

POST Body
~~~~~~~~~

The body of the post is a string representation of a JSON object and is
(optionally and preferably) gzipped and then (necessarily) base64
encoded.  

This JSON object contains the following fields:

    :``message``: the text of the formatted logging record.
    :``timestamp``: indicates when the logging record was created (in the Sentry client).  The Sentry server assumes the time is in UTC.
                    The timestamp should be in ISO 8601 format, without a timezone. For example: 2011-05-02T17:41:36
    :``level``: the record severity.
    :``message_id``: hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value.
    :``logger``: which logger created the record.  If missing, defaults to the string ``root``, not to the root logger.
    :``view``: function call which was the primary perpetrator.
    :``server_name``: optional, identifies the Sentry client from which the record comes.
    :``url``: optional.
    :``site``: optional, makes sense if you use sites.
    :``data``: a further JSON hash containing optional metadata and some Sentry magic. (to avoid confusion, it would be nice to call this field ``metadata``).

Some of the above fields (``server_name``, ``url``, ``site``) are
optional and actually a legacy of the first Sentry client, a
Django application. They may eventually be moved to the ``metadata`` field.
