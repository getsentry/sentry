Command Line Usage
==================

Sentry installs a command line script under the name ``sentry``. This will
allow you to perform most required operations that are unachievable within
the web UI.

If you're using a non-standard configuration location make sure you to pass the
configuration via the ``SENTRY_CONF`` environment variable::

    SENTRY_CONF=/www/sentry/sentry.conf.py sentry help

For a list of commands, you can also use ``sentry help``, or ``sentry
[command] --help`` for help on a specific command.

Builtin Commands

    .. note:: The init command requires you to pass the configuration
              value as the parameter whereas other commands require you
              to use --config for passing the location of this file.

    data.
