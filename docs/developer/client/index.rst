Writing a Client
================

.. note:: This document describes protocol version 5.

A client at its core is simply a set of utilities for capturing various
logging parameters. Given these parameters, it then builds a JSON payload
which it will send to a Sentry server using some sort of authentication
method.

The following items are expected of production-ready clients:

* DSN configuration
* Graceful failures (e.g. Sentry server unreachable)
* Scrubbing w/ processors
* Tag support

Feature based support is required for the following:

* If cookie data is available, it's not sent by default
* If POST data is available, it's not sent by default

Additionally, the following features are highly encouraged:

* Automated error handling (e.g. default error handlers)
* Logging integration (to whatever standard solution is available)
* Non-blocking event submission
* Basic data sanitization (e.g. filtering out values that look like passwords)


Client Usage (End-user)
-----------------------

Generally, a client consists of three steps to the end user, which should look
almost identical no matter the language:

1. Creation of the client (sometimes this is hidden to the user)

  ::

      var myClient = new RavenClient('http://public_key:secret_key@example.com/project-id');

2. Capturing an event

  ::

      var $resultId = myClient->captureException($myException);

3. Using the result of an event capture

  ::

      println('Your exception was recorded as %s', $resultId);

The constructor ideally allows several configuration methods. The first argument should
always be the DSN value (if possible), followed by an optional secondary argument which is
a map of options::

    client = new RavenClient('http://public_key:secret_key@example.com/project-id', {
        'tags': {'foo': 'bar'}
    })

.. note:: If an empty DSN is passed, you should treat it as valid option which signifies disabling the client.

Which options you support is up to you, but ideally you would provide defaults for generic values
that can be passed to the capture methods.

Once you accept the options, you should output a logging message describing whether the client has been configured
actively (as in, it will send to the remote server), or if it has been disabled. This should be done with whatever
standard logging module is available for your platform.

Additionally, you should provide methods (depending on the platform) which allow for capturing of a basic message and
an exception-type:

* RavenClient::captureMessage(string $message)
* RavenClient::captureException(exception $exception)

The above methods should also allow optional arguments (or a map of arguments). For example::

    client.captureException(myException, {
        'tags': {'foo': 'bar'},
    })

If your platform supports block statements, it is recommend you provide something
like the following::

    with client.captureExceptions(tags={'foo': 'bar'}):
        # do something that will cause an error
        1 / 0

.. note:: In the above example, we're passing any options that would normally be passed to the capture methods along with
          the block wrapper.

Finally, provide a CLI to test your client's configuration. Python example::

    raven test http://public_key:secret_key@example.com/project-id

Ruby example::

    rake raven:test http://public_key:secret_key@example.com/project-id

Parsing the DSN
---------------

Clients are encouraged to allow arbitrary options via the constructor, but must
allow the first argument as a DSN string. This string contains the following bits:

::

    '{PROTOCOL}://{PUBLIC_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}@{HOST}/{PATH}{PROJECT_ID}'

For example, given the following constructor::

    new RavenClient('https://public:secret@example.com/sentry/project-id')

You should parse the following settings:

* URI = 'https://example.com/sentry/'
* Public Key = 'public'
* Secret Key = 'secret'
* Project ID = 'project-id'

If any of these values are not present, the client should notify the user immediately
that they've misconfigured the client.

The final endpoint you'll be sending requests to is constructed per the following:

::

    '{URI}api/{PROJECT ID}/store/'

So in this case, it would end up as:

::

    'https://example.com/sentry/api/project-id/store/'


The protocol value may also include a transport option. For example, in the Python client several
transports are available on top of HTTP:

* ``gevent+http``
* ``threaded+http``
* ``zmq+tcp``

Building the JSON Packet
------------------------

The body of the post is a string representation of a JSON object. It is also preferably gzip encoded,
which also means its expected to be base64-encoded.

For example, with an included Exception event, a basic JSON body might resemble the following::

        {
            "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0",
            "culprit": "my.module.function_name",
            "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36",
            "message": "SyntaxError: Wattttt!",
            "tags": {
                "ios_version": "4.0"
            },
            "exception": [{
                "type": "SyntaxError":
                "value": "Wattttt!",
                "module": "__builtins__"
            }]
        }

The following attributes are required for all events:

.. data:: event_id

    Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value.

    Maximum length is 32 characters.

    ::

        {
            "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0"
        }

.. data:: message

    User-readable representation of this event

    Maximum length is 1000 characters.

    ::

        {
            "message": "SyntaxError: Wattttt!"
        }

.. data:: timestamp

    Indicates when the logging record was created (in the Sentry client).

    Defaults to ``datetime.datetime.utcnow()``

    The Sentry server assumes the time is in UTC.

    The timestamp should be in ISO 8601 format, without a timezone.

    ::

        {
            "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36"
        }

.. data:: level

    The record severity.

    Defaults to ``error``.

    The value can either be the integer value or the string label
    as specified in ``SENTRY_LOG_LEVELS``.

    ::

        {
            "level": "warning"
        }

    Acceptable values are:

    * fatal
    * error
    * warning
    * info
    * debug

.. data:: logger

    The name of the logger which created the record.

    If missing, defaults to the string ``root``.

    ::

        {
            "logger": "my.logger.name"
        }

Additionally, there are several optional values which Sentry recognizes and are
highly encouraged:


.. data:: platform

    A string representing the platform the client is submitting from. This will
    be used by the Sentry interface to customize various components in the
    interface.

    ::

        {
            "platform": "python"
        }

    .. versionadded:: 5.1.0


.. data:: culprit

    Function call which was the primary perpetrator of this event.

    ::

        {
            "culprit": "my.module.function_name"
        }

.. data:: tags

    A map or list of tags for this event.

    ::

        {
            "tags": {
                "ios_version": "4.0",
                "context": "production"
            }
        }

    ::

        {
            "tags": [
                ["ios_version", "4.0"],
                ["context", "production"]
            ]
        }

.. data:: server_name

    Identifies the host client from which the event was recorded.

    ::

        {
            "server_name": "foo.example.com"
        }

.. data:: modules

    A list of relevant modules and their versions.

    ::

        {
            "modules": {
                "my.module.name": "1.0"
            }
        }

.. data:: extra

    An arbitrary mapping of additional metadata to store with the event.

    ::

        {
            "extra": {
                "my_key": 1,
                "some_other_value": "foo bar"
            }
        }

Any additional value is assumed to be a data interface, where the key is the Python path to the interface
class name, and the value is the data expected by the interface. Interfaces are used in a variety of ways
including storing stacktraces, HTTP request information, and other metadata.

See :doc:`../interfaces/index` for information on Sentry's builtin interfaces and how to create your own.

Authentication
--------------

An authentication header is expected to be sent along with the message body, which acts as an ownership identifier::

    X-Sentry-Auth: Sentry sentry_version=5,
    sentry_client=<client version, arbitrary>,
    sentry_timestamp=<current timestamp>,
    sentry_key=<public api key>,
    sentry_secret=<secret api key>

.. note:: You should include the client version string in the User-Agent portion of the header, and it will be used if
          sentry_client is not sent in the auth header.

.. data:: sentry_version

    The protocol version. This should be sent as the value '5'.

.. data:: sentry_client

    An arbitrary string which identifies your client, including its version.

    The typical pattern for this is '**client_name**/**client_version**'.

    For example, the Python client might send this as 'raven-python/1.0'.

.. data:: sentry_timestamp

    The unix timestamp representing the time at which this event was generated.

.. data:: sentry_key

    The public key which should be provided as part of the client configuration.

.. data:: sentry_secret

    The secret key which should be provided as part of the client configuration.

    .. note:: You should only pass the secret key if you're communicating via
              secure communication to the server. Client-side behavior (such
              as JavaScript) should use CORS, and only pass the public key.

crossdomain.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.1.0

Cross domain requests from flash are supported within the API by specifying sub-policy, which is located at
`/api/<project id>/crossdomain.xml`.

A Working Example
-----------------

When all is said and done, you should be sending an HTTP POST request to a Sentry webserver, where
the path is the BASE_URI/api/PROJECT_ID/store/. So given the following DSN::

    https://b70a31b3510c4cf793964a185cfe1fd0:b7d80b520139450f903720eb7991bf3d@example.com/1

The request body should then somewhat resemble the following::

    POST /api/project-id/store/
    User-Agent: raven-python/1.0
    X-Sentry-Auth: Sentry sentry_version=5, sentry_timestamp=1329096377,
        sentry_key=b70a31b3510c4cf793964a185cfe1fd0, sentry_client=raven-python/1.0,
        sentry_secret=b7d80b520139450f903720eb7991bf3d

    {
        "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0",
        "culprit": "my.module.function_name",
        "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36",
        "message": "SyntaxError: Wattttt!",
        "exception": [{
            "type": "SyntaxError",
            "value": "Wattttt!",
            "module": "__builtins__"
        }]
    }

Reading the Response
--------------------

If you're using HTTP, you'll receive a response from the server. The response
looks something like this:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0"
    }

One thing to take note of is the response status code. Sentry uses this in a
variety of ways. You'll **always** want to check for a 200 response if you want
to ensure that the message was delivered, as a small level of validation
happens immediately that may result in a different response code (and message).

For example, you might get something like this:

::


    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    X-Sentry-Error: Client request error: Missing client version identifier

    Client request error: Missing client version identifier


.. note:: The X-Sentry-Error header will always be present with the precise
          error message and it is the preferred way to identify the root cause.

          If it's not available, it's likely the request was not handled by the
          API server, or a critical system failure has occurred.

Handling Failures
-----------------

It is **highly encouraged** that your client handles failures from the Sentry server gracefully. This means taking
care of several key things:

* Soft failures when the Sentry server fails to respond in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. 3s)
* Exponential backoff when Sentry fails (don't continue trying if the server is offline)
* Failover to a standard logging module on errors.

For example, the Python client will log any failed requests to the Sentry server to a named logger, ``sentry.errors``.
It will also only retry every few seconds, based on how many consecutive failures its seen. The code for this is simple::

    def should_try(self):
        if self.status == self.ONLINE:
            return True

        interval = min(self.retry_number, 6) ** 2

        if time.time() - self.last_check > interval:
            return True

        return False

Scrubbing Data
--------------

Clients should provide some mechanism for scrubbing data. Ideally through an extensible interface that the user
can customize the behavior of.

This is generally done as part of the client configuration::

    client = Client(..., {
        'processors': ['processor.className'],
    })

Each processor listed would be some sort of extensible class or a function callback. It would have a single designated
method that is passed the data (after it's been populated), and would then return the data fully intact, or modified
with various bits filtered out.

For example, if you simply supported callbacks for processors, it might look like this::

    function my_processor($data) {
        foreach ($data['extra'] as $key => $value) {
            if (strpos($value, 'password')) {
                $data[$key] = '********';
            }
        }
    }

We recommend scrubbing the following values::

* Values where the keyname matches 'password', 'passwd', or 'secret'.
* Values that match the regular expression of ``r'^(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}$'`` (credit card-like).
* Session cookies.
* The Authentication header (HTTP).

Keep in mind, that if your client is passing extra interface data (e.g. HTTP POST variables) you will also
want to scrub those interfaces. Given that, it is a good idea to simply recursively scrub most variables
other than predefined things (like HTTP headers).

Tags
----

Tags are key/value pairs that describe an event. They should be configurable in the following contexts:

* Environment (client-level)
* Thread (block-level)
* Event (as part of capture)

Each of these should inherit its parent. So for example, if you configure your client as so::

    client = Client(..., {
        'tags': {'foo': 'bar'},
    })

And then you capture an event::

    client.captureMessage('test', {
        'tags': {'foo': 'baz'},
    })

The client should send the following upstream for ``tags``::

    {
        "tags": [
            ["foo", "bar"],
            ["foo", "baz"]
        ],
    }

You should also provide relevant contextual interfaces. These should last for the lifecycle of a request, and the general interface is "bind some kind of context", and then at the end of a request lifecycle, clear any present context.

This interface consists of \*_context methods, as well as a "clear context" method. The following is an example API which is implemented in most clients:

::

    # Bind sentry.interfaces.User
    client.user_context({
        'email': 'foo@example.com',
    })

    # Merge in additional tag context
    client.tags_context({
        'key': 'value',
    })

    # Merge in additional extra context
    client.extra_context({
        'key': 'value',
    })

    # Clear context
    client.context.clear()

Some additional examples of context helpers which might be relevant:

- http_context(data) -- bind sentry.interfaces.Http
- wsgi_context(env) -- bind http_context based on a wsgi environment


Variable Size
-------------

Most arbitrary values in Sentry have their size restricted. This means any
values that are sent as metadata (such as variables in a stacktrace) as well
as things like extra data, or tags.

- Mappings of values (such as HTTP data, extra data, etc) are limited to 50
  item pairs.
- Event IDs are limited to 32 characters.
- Tag keys are limited to 32 characters.
- Tag values are limited to 200 characters.
- Culprits are limited to 200 characters.
- Most contextual variables are limited to 512 characters.
- Extra contextual data is limited to 4096 characters.
- Messages are limited to ~10kb.
- Http data (the body) is limited to 2048 characters.
- Stacktrace's are limited to 50 frames. If more are sent, data will be removed from the middle of the stack.
