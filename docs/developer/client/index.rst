Writing a Client
================

A client at its core is simply a set of utilities for capturing various
logging parameters. Given these parameters, it then builds a JSON payload
which it will send to a Sentry server using some sort of authentication
method.

Generally, a client consists of three steps to the end user, which should look
almost identical no matter the language:

1. Creation of the client (sometimes this is hidden to the user)

  ::

      var myClient = new RavenClient('http://public_key:secret_key@example.com/default');

2. Capturing an event

  ::

      var $resultId = myClient->captureException($myException);

3. Using the result of an event capture

  ::

      println("Your exception was recorded as %s", $resultId);

The standard methods as of writing which all clients are expected to provide are:

* RavenClient::captureMessage(string $message)
* RavenClient::captureException(exception $exception)

Parsing the DSN
---------------

Clients are encouraged to allow arbitrary options via the constructor, but must
allow the first argument as a DSN string. This string contains the following bits:

::

    '{PROTOCOL}://{PUBLIC_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}@{HOST}/{PATH}{PROJECT_ID}'

For example, given the following constructor::

    new RavenClient('https://public:secret@example.com/sentry/default')

You should parse the following settings:

* URI = 'https://example.com/sentry/''
* Public Key = 'public'
* Secret Key = 'secret'
* Project ID = 'default'

If any of these values are not present, the client should notify the user immediately
that they've misconfigured the client.

Building the JSON Packet
------------------------

The body of the post is a string representation of a JSON object. It is also preferably gzipped encoding,
which also means its expected to be base64-encoded.

For example, with an included Exception event, a basic JSON body might resemble the following::

        {
            "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0",
            "project": "default",
            "culprit": "my.module.function_name",
            "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36",
            "message": "SyntaxError: Wattttt!"
            "sentry.interfaces.Exception": {
                "type": "SyntaxError":
                "value": "Wattttt!",
                "module": "__builtins__"
            }
        }

The following attributes are required for all events:

.. data:: project

    String value representing the project

    ::

        {
            "project": "default"
        }

.. data:: event_id

    Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value.

    ::

        {
            "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0"
        }

.. data:: message

    User-readable representation of this event

    ::

        {
            "message": "SyntaxError: Wattttt!"
        }

.. data:: timestamp

    Indicates when the logging record was created (in the Sentry client).

    Defaults to ``datetime.datetime.utcnow()``

    The Sentry server assumes the time is in UTC.

    The timestamp should be in ISO 8601 format, without a timezone.

    ::

        {
            "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36"
        }

.. data:: level

    The record severity.

    Defaults to ``logging.ERROR``.

    The value can either be the integer value or the string label
    as specified in ``SENTRY_LOG_LEVELS``.

    ::

        {
            "level": "warn"
        }

.. data:: logger

    The name of the logger which created the record.

    If missing, defaults to the string ``root``.

    ::

        {
            "logger": "my.logger.name"
        }

Additionally, there are several optional values which Sentry recognizes and are
highly encouraged:

.. data:: culprit

    Function call which was the primary perpetrator of this event.

    ::

        {
            "culprit": "my.module.function_name"
        }

.. data:: server_name

    Identifies the host client from which the event was recorded.

    ::

        {
            "server_name": "foo.example.com"
        }

.. data:: modules

    A list of relevant modules and their versions.

    ::

        {
            "modules": [
                {
                    "my.module.name": "1.0"
                }
            ]
        }

.. data:: extra

    An arbitrary mapping of additional metadata to store with the event.

    ::

        {
            "extra": {
                "my_key": 1,
                "some_other_value": "foo bar"
            }
        }

Any additional value is assumed to be a data interface, where the key is the Python path to the interface
class name, and the value is the data expected by the interface. Interfaces are used in a variety of ways
including storing stacktraces, HTTP request information, and other metadata.

See :doc:`../interfaces/index` for information on Sentry's builtin interfaces and how to create your own.

Authentication
--------------

An authentication header is expected to be sent along with the message body, which acts as as an ownership identifier::

    X-Sentry-Auth: Sentry sentry_version=2.0,
    sentry_client=<client version, arbitrary>,
    sentry_timestamp=<current timestamp>,
    sentry_key=<public api key>

.. data:: sentry_version

    The protocol version. This should be sent as the value "2.0".

.. data:: sentry_client

    An arbitrary string which identifies your client, including its version.

    For example, the Python client might send this as "raven-python/1.0"

.. data:: sentry_timestamp

    The unix timestamp representing the time at which this POST request was generated.

.. data:: sentry_key

    The public key which should be provided as part of the client configuration


A Working Example
-----------------

When all is said and done, you should be sending an HTTP POST request to a Sentry webserver, where
the path is the BASE_URI/api/store/. So given the following DSN::

    https://b70a31b3510c4cf793964a185cfe1fd0:b7d80b520139450f903720eb7991bf3d@example.com/1

The request body should then somewhat resemble the following::

    POST /api/store/
    X-Sentry-Auth: Sentry sentry_version=2.0, sentry_timestamp=1329096377,
        sentry_key=b70a31b3510c4cf793964a185cfe1fd0, sentry_client=raven-python/1.0

    {
        "project": "default",
        "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0",
        "culprit": "my.module.function_name",
        "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36",
        "message": "SyntaxError: Wattttt!"
        "sentry.interfaces.Exception": {
            "type": "SyntaxError":
            "value": "Wattttt!",
            "module": "__builtins__"
        }
    }
