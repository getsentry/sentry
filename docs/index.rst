Sentry
======

Sentry is a realtime event logging and aggregation platform. At its core it
specializes in monitoring errors and extracting all the information needed
to do a proper post-mortem without any of the hassle of the standard user
feedback loop.

It's important to note that Sentry should not be thought of as a log stream,
but as an event aggregator. It fits somewhere in-between a simple metrics
solution (such as `Graphite <http://graphite.wikidot.com/>`_) and a full-on
log stream aggregator (like `Logstash <http://logstash.net/>`_).
