comment:
  # after_n_builds declared in flags cannot control when to make comments
  # A value of 11 will mean that only BE PRs will get a comment (only if the score changes)
  # XXX: Once commenting pays attention to the value in flags we can add comments to FE PRs

  # Update, if comment exists. Otherwise post new.
  behavior: default
  # Comments will only post when coverage changes. Furthermore, if a comment
  # already exists, and a newer commit results in no coverage change for the
  # entire pull, the comment will be deleted.
