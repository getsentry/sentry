# For some tools, we install them locally (in the virtualenv).
# This makes it easier to use them directly (as opposed to pre-commit run),
# and it's also faster as pre-commit doesn't have to manage them.
# The thing we lose here is autoupdate, but we have git hooks that
# let you know when requirements-pre-commit.txt changes.
